policy focuses on Scotland's relationship with the EU post-independence,  they don't express a position on how the UK should interact with the EU. They more generally argue that an independent Scotland should re-enter the EFTA as a first step towards improving access to EU markets.","Alba policy focuses on Scotland's relationship with the EU post-independence,  they don't express a position on the UK re-joining that I can see.","The party frames aspects of its equalities policy in terms of the ECHR - this (albeit implicitly) would signal an opposition to the UK withdrawing.","Deputy leader column","The party equalities policy describes 'our continued support for safe and legal routes for refugees and asylum seekers and our opposition to the UK Government’s inhumane asylum policy.'","Party Tweet endorsing candidate article condemning this policy","The party equalities policy describes 'our continued support for safe and legal routes for refugees and asylum seekers and our opposition to the UK Government’s inhumane asylum policy.'","The party is arguing that this not being enshrined is a key shortcoming of the SNP's Hate Crime Law.","I think that they'd be against this overall, but I couldn't find a position statement.","The quote I used here is: We believe in the continuation of North Sea Oil on the condition that all new oil and gas licences should require a specific field commitment of a zero net carbon footprint achieved largely by investment in the developing carbon capture network. This seems like a bit of a cop-out to me, but it does commit to net zero.","Clear statement here","Albeit - they envision this being a Scottish government approach, rather than a UK one.","Couldn't find a source, suspect they would support this in principle.","This is a Scotland specific issue.","They don't make a specific statement regarding inheritance tax, but their wider approach is to increase progressive taxation.","Their proposed tax system increases higher rate taxes.","I couldn't find any party statement on this policy.","Clear statement of opposition here.","Clear statement against this approach from Westminster leader.","Their policy focuses more on state control, but they do say 'Given the £200million housing budget cut we need to make it easier for local authorities to build homes' again, no proposal regarding greenfield sites.","Statement opposing self-ID as enshrined in Scottish government proposals","Couldn't find a source, suspect they would support this in principle.","Couldn't find a source, suspect they would support this in principle.",null,null,null,"From party's 'Independence Policy' section: 'Independence for Scotland is our raison d'etre'","Couldn't find a source, suspect they would support this in principle.",null,null,null,null,"Alba does not refer to the UK as a whole rejoining the EU. EU membership is a long-term goal of an independent Scotland \"if the people of Scotland so choose\". EU membership is implied to be a preference but open to a referendum. EU membership would not be the immediate priority, which is instead joining the EFTA to gain access to the EEA to help Scotland with independence negotiations with Westminster and show commitment to EU member states on potentially rejoining. I code 'agree' because although the party is clearly pro-EU membership, there are several qualifications, including a Scottish independence and a referendum.","Alba does not refer to the UK's participation in the EU's CFSP etc. Since Alba is a pro-EU party, the implication of this is acceptance of EU institutions, especially as no criticism is levied against the institution from the party level. Given the party's position on EU membership, I have coded them in favour of the statement. I hove coded agree and not completely agree because increased cooperation in this field would be contingent on Scottish independence given no preference is given for the UK wide foreign and security cooperation with the EU.","Alba does not make specific reference to the UK's membership of the ECHR, but it has made statements committing to the ECHR in the context of the Rwanda policy. For example, Alba Party Westminster leader Neale Hanvey said, \"The Tories will be calling for the UK to leave the European Human Rights Court and Labour will be in a race to the bottom on immigration\". A completely disagree code is given as support for the ECHR is not contingent on Scottish independence.","Alba have made statements on de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and Palestine. However, it has made no reference to stopping arms exports to Israel. The closest statement revealing some position is: \"But we cannot have any complicity in the atrocity being perpetrated in Gaza yet we’re veering dangerously towards that. It’s bad enough that armaments have been supplied. They may not directly be the weapons of war, but they form part of them. Ejection seats may seem benign but when they’re installed in fighter jets, it’s a different matter entirely. And the inventory’s lengthy\". This is not an explicit call for halting sales but does condemn that the sales have happened, and that the UK government is thus complicit. From this I infer Alba completely agrees with the statement as there appears to be no qualifications to Alba's criticism of the British government issuing export licences, although this is made with low confidence as they make no reference to stopping arms sales.","Alba calls itself a pro-immigration party and calls for \"safe and legal routes for refugees and asylum seekers and our opposition to the UK Government’s inhumane asylum policy\". On the Rwanda policy itself, Alba Westminster Lead Neale Hanvey expressed disdain for the policy and calls for an independent Scotland to have a \"fair immigration policy suited to the needs of Scotland to help grow our population\". A clear 'completely disagree' is applied.","Alba makes no direct mention of the policy and has not made statement about the recent announcement, so I code 'no opinion'.","Alba does not make explicit reference to the number of refugees that should be welcomed from conflict zones, but the position can be inferred by a preference for welcoming immigration into Scotland and promoting fair processes for refugees and asylum seekers. A completely agree code is given.","Alba has disagreed with the proposed Misogyny law of Holyrood because of its including protections for trans women. The party considers that \"women have the right to maintain their sex-based protections as set out in the Equality Act 2010\", which does not mean including misogyny as a hate crime but their disagreements with the SNP indicate a preference for this policy. Overall, I code agree since there is a qualification that such laws do not provide protections for trans women, as this has been a major political position of Alba.","I found no statements by party or leadership on the issue of mandatory prison sentences for petty crime.","Alba commits to Net Zero explicitly in its energy policy on North Sea resources but makes no reference to the policy elsewhere. The party wishes to develop North Sea energy with net zero obligations attached to projects. Net Zero is thus included within its wider programme of energy security. Since there are no reservations about Net Zero targets on North Sea fossil fuels, I code 'completely disagree' as it can be inferred that such a policy would extend elsewhere given the salience of North Sea energy to the Scottish economy.","Alba believes in the continuation of exploitation of North Sea oil on the condition projects commit to net zero through carbon capture. However, on the issue of the 'UK' exploiting this oil, Alba prefers Scotland being the main beneficiaries of revenue. Alba calls for joint Holyrood and Westminster cooperation to protect core energy refining infrastructure, notably the Grangemouth facility. Due to the qualifications of Scotland being the main beneficiaries of North Sea oil, and for Net Zero policies to be implemented in the industry, I code 'disagree', although it could be argued that these qualifications are minor and a 'completely disagree' could be coded (given the centrality of North Sea oil in an independent Scotland).","Alba does not reference a UK energy company. It has a very clear policy that \"the Scottish Government should immediately form a public energy company to serve the best interests of the people of Scotland\". Since the policy is about the Scottish government with no reference to whether this is in its current form or in an independent Scotland, I code completely agree as there are no qualifications for independence.","Alba commits to a Minimum Income Guarantee, which is considered a first step towards universal basic income. However, the party makes no reference to the minimum wage, although the policy would indicate a level playing field for minimum wage. Therefore, I code 'no opinion'.","Scotland already has 30 hours a week free childcare (during term time). The policy of expanding hours is not on the agenda (Alba does propose an increase in weekly Child Payments). I code 'no opinion'.","I found no statements by party or leadership on inheritance tax preferences.","Alba supports a progressive taxation system to help support public services and social security systems: \"If Scotland is to have the best public services possible and a social security system based on fairness, which rejects the Westminster system of punishing those most in need in our society, then we require a far bolder and more progressive tax system\". This also includes a luxury goods tax and a windfall tax on energy companies. This is an unambiguous complete agreement with the policy statement.","I found no statements by party or leadership on the status of private schools.","Alba disagrees with the two-child benefit cap. However, the party wants to 'mitigate' the effects of the cap \"by utilising its existing social security powers to boost payments to large families\". The party therefore does not make direct reference to dropping the cap but shows disagreement with the policy and works to ease its effect. From this we can infer that Alba would wish to scrap the cap, so 'complete agreement' is coded.","Alba warns about any proposed privatisation of the NHS and use the argument that \"mission creep\" of the NHS privatisation negatively impacts healthcare in Scotland. Alba unambiguously completely disagrees with the policy.","Alba shows no preferences around greenfield developments. Yet on the issue of social housing, it is clear they do not see Holyrood's current social housing and housebuilding policy as ambitious enough. I code agree only since we cannot infer location preferences.","Alba rejects the SNP Scottish Government Gender Recognition Bill, which allows gender self-identification: \"Alba opposes gender self-identification as a replacement for the current legal process of gaining a Gender Recognition Certificate\". They clearly completely disagree with the policy.","Alba makes no reference to the preferred electoral system. Any discussion about what electoral system should be had is contingent on independence, and that such decisions should be made with consultation from citizens assemblies as to the electoral system and other issues of constitution. Therefore, Alba has no opinion on what the voting system should be yet.","The voting age for Scottish Parliament and Local Elections is already 16 in Scotland, but not for UK wide elections. There are no statements about preference for voting age in General Elections.",null,null,null,"The main policy objective of Alba is Scottish Independence: \"Independence for Scotland is our raison d'etre\".","No sources could be found on the official position of Alba on GM crops. The SNP restricted GM crops in 2015 in Scotland when current leader of Alba, Alex Salmond, was one of the SNPs MPs in Westminster. Yet this issue appears to be off the Alba agenda. This may be because the issue is settled, and Alba are content with the status quo (which would mean agreement) but the party have made zero references to the policy.","Alba is actively opposed to the Scottish Government's Hate Crime and Public Order Act 2021 and seek to repeal the act, arguing that it does not safeguard women. Alba point to \"how anyone can lawfully exercise their now-established Equality Act protections for gender-critical beliefs without that being declared a hate crime\". Alba has made statements in support of Lesbian, Gay, and Bi people and consider just LGB rights whilst ignoring and actively fighting against Trans and Non-binary rights etc. From this it could be argued that a disagree code can be given because this could mean that Alba wants to protect some sexual minorities from Hate Speech. However, overall, the issue is framed as an issue of free speech, and no further reference is made to actively defending LGB people from Hate Speech. Because of this absence of clear aims to protect LGB people from hate speech, active barring protections for TQ+ people, and framing the issue as one of free speech, I code a 'complete disagree' as there are no clear qualifications for Alba to simply 'disagree' with the policy.",null,null,null,"Whist Alba laments Brexit, its priority is to join EFTA in the near future, while keeping rejoining the EU itself as a possible long-term objective. The party's website states \"EFTA membership would enable Scotland to negotiate to become a full member of the EU in due course if the people of Scotland so choose whilst enjoying the benefits of free trade, thus placing Scotland in a much stronger negotiating position with the EU for future membership.”","Alba wants to leave NATO. At the same time it pledges that Scotland will cooperate with NATO via UN-sanctioned operations or in non-nuclear defensive exercises and work for stability, peace, and democracy via the OSCE. No mention is made of the EU, but the implication is that outside NATO deeper co-operation with EU partners would not be a priority.","In its website Alba says it \"believes that all of Scotland’s faith communities have the right to practice their faith in line with Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which protects an individual's right to freedom of religion and belief.\" By implication, therefore, it supports the ECHR.","Alba has called for de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and Palestine. Moreover, Kenny MacAskill, Alba MP for East Lothian, signed a motion urging the Government to immediately halt all transfers of military equipment and technology to Israel.","Alba Party Westminster leader Neale Hanvey MP strongly criticised the Rwanda scheme saying “The transportation of vulnerable refugees was always inhuman and now we know it was always unlawful.”","I could not find any references to Alba’s plans regarding national service.","On its website Alba says \"The ALBA Party is a pro-immigration party, that recognises the tremendous contribution that New Scots, who decide to make Scotland their home, make to wider society. This has been demonstrated by our continued support for safe and legal routes for refugees and asylum seekers and our opposition to the UK Government’s inhumane asylum policy.\"","Earlier this year Alba launched a campaign to repeal the Hate Crime Act. The party says it cannot support the Hate Crimes Act, in part because it doesn't include within it more comprehensive protections against misogyny. This would suggest that they support including misogyny as a hate crime.","I could not find any references to Alba’s plans regarding national service.","Alba is nominally committed to net zero, but believes this can be achieved, in part at least, by carbon capture. On its website it states: \"We believe in the continuation of North Sea Oil on the condition that all new oil and gas licences should require a specific field commitment of a zero net carbon footprint achieved largely by investment in the developing carbon capture network.\"","On the party's website it states \"We believe in the continuation of North Sea Oil on the condition that all new oil and gas licences should require a specific field commitment of a zero net carbon footprint achieved largely by investment in the developing carbon capture network.\"","On the party's website it states \"It is ALBA's position that the Scottish Government should immeditately form a public energy company to serve the best interests of the people of Scotland.\"","On the party's website it states: \"Scotland should have; initially a Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), which is a universal guaranteed income for every Scot, delivered through targeted payments and free of behavioural conditions.\" Although it is not explicit about 18-20 year-olds, the mention of \"every Scot\" and the commitment to tackling inequality suggests that the party strongly supports this idea.","The party seems to  effectively prioritise paying mothers a universal guaranteed income for looking after their children over paying for (institutional) childcare. However, because the fifteen hour allocation does not apply in Scotland, I am not sure this item is relevant in Scotland.","I could not find much evidence on this, but given Alba's overall commitment to economic equality and given Alex Salmond's support for the policy in 2015, when he was in the House of Commons, I would expect Alba to completely disagree with this policy.","On the party's website it states \"If Scotland is to have the best public services possible and a social security system based on fairness, which rejects the Westminster system of punishing those most in need in our society, then we require a far bolder and more progressive tax system.\" It then proposes increasing income tax for wealthier Scots (earning more than £70,000 per year).","I can find no information about Alba’s policy on private schools. However, given Alba’s overall commitment to reducing economic inequalities I would assume that the party would disagree with this.","On the part's website it states \"The ALBA Party Fundamentally Opposes The Callous Tory Two-Child Benefit Cap\".","Alba opposes any private sector involvement in the NHS. Alba Party’s Westminster leader Neale Hanvey MP says that “it’s now clear that whether Scots end up with a Labour Government or a Tory Government after the election,  a new and devastating privatisation agenda will be front and centre of NHS reforms.”","In its section on housing Alba makes no mention of whether it is in favour or against building on Greenfield sites. I could also find no information on this through browsing the web.","Alba's only MSP Ash Regan comments on the \"Public outcry subsequently discredited Self-ID by the indelible images of a double rapist in pink leggings being housed in the female prison estate, highlighting the incredulous position of the Scottish Prison Service policy moving ahead of the law of Self-ID.\"","While I could not find any specific references to Alba's desired voting system, the party's leader Alex Salmond once praised hung parliaments (the typical result of any PR contest) as “balanced parliaments” commenting that this development would be welcomed in Scotland.

Sunaks government has passed legislation which could no have been possible prior to Brexit so are clearly content with the outcome and would not want to rejoin.","Whilst there has not been much discussion around this recently from the party, they have failed to attend meetings thus far throughout the Brexit discussions. However, the documents suggest that the government is working on the evolutionn of the EU-UK relationship following threats to the security of the EU such as the war in Ukraine.","Sunak stated on the ITV debate on 04/06 that he would be open to withdrawing from the ECHR if they blocked his Rwanda scheme. He stated that he believes the policy is in line with the ECHR but said \"if I'm forced to choose between securing our borders and our country's security or a foreign court, I'm going to choose our country's security every single time\" so has left the door open on the issue.","The party and leader seem to be facing pressure to cease the sale of arms to Israel and face in-party disputes on the issue. There seems to be no real consensus only that they are looking into whether any International Humanitarian Laws have been broken and until they have broken any laws they will not stop selling rhe arms to Israel","The Conservative website states their plan if they are elected is to \"see the Rwanda plan through\".","The Conservative website says their plann includes introducing the National Service for 18 year olds. The PM also defended this on the  ITV debate.","The Conservatve website says \"We can be proud of our generosity towards people fleeing conflict and persecution in Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan. But the level of migration is not sustainable\" whilst this does not argue that it is no longer possible, the added needs to enter the country include a 48% salary increase and raising the price of family Visas.

In saying this, Sunak has been accused of watering down the targets and Liz Truss has advised that this should be scrapped to ensure the election win so we willl have to wait to see if this is taken on board for the party.","The plan and bill introduced by Sunak aims to introduce annual licenses to extract oil from the North Sea arguing that it will be needed, even after reaching net zero and will create jobs.","Conservative Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho has attacked Labour's plans to introduce a new publicly owned energy company and so, whilst I cannot find much on this, can assume that this is not on the cards for the Conservatives","From the newly implemented national living wage available to those aged 21+ compared to the minimum wage which those aged 18-20 can get identifies that the Conservatives do not wish to extend the same wages to those aged 18-20. However, there has not been much recent discussion on the issue as we approach the election.","Sunak plans to continue with his plans to extend childcare for families with the Conservative website stating it plans to double childcare to 30 hours for all children under 5 by September 2024","Whilst it has not been discussed much as of yet, Jeremy Hunt has branded Inheritence Tax 'Anti-Conservative' and has promised tax breaks for the middle class so I assume there are plans in place for the upcoming election. It has also been speculated that cutting inheritence tax could be the 'winner' for the Conservatives this election.","What is known thus far is that any extra money obtained, the Conservatives are not planning to use for public services. Their Spring budget allowed for just 1% of extra funding for puublic services according to Hunt. Additionally, the increase in non-dom tax will be spent on cutting other taxes rather than on public services as Labour have set out to do.","With the PM arguing that Labour would invite a class war if they introduced taxation for private schools and withtin a debate the financial secretary arguing that taxing private schools would cause a 'knock on effect' for state schools there is no intentions for the party to stop this tax break","In his article in the Sun Sunak promises he will keep the 2 child benefit cap and that this will be in the parties manifesto","Whilst this plan is fairly new for the party it is in place.

This is thought to be a part of the Conservative manifesto.",null,"I could not find many sourceson this issue, other than Conservative MP's accusing Labour of wanting 16 year olds to vote to 'fix the election'. If they think that including 16 year olds would benefit Labour then I cannot see the party wanting this.",null,"I can't find discussion around this recently from the Conservatives except that they think they have improved schools and academies and slander Labours plans to change the curriculums at all. I would assume therefore that the party have no plans to make changes to the curriculum for academies","It seems at the moment there is no general thought amongst the party on this from the PM or leading members. The plan seemed to be to scrap LTN's but the report requested by the PM had positive findings which have led to the party putting decisions on local councils to work with residents. There has been a call from some back benchers to abolish them but we are yet to see what comes of this.","The Scottish Conservatives vow to end the 'independence obsession' and do not seek independence from the UK.","Scotland did not consent and did not wish for it to be legal to grow GM crops but the Conservatives implemented a bill which meant that any goods sold in England could be sold in Scotland to bipass this issue. Emphasising that whilst Scottish parties did not want this, the Conservative government do.","In response to the Hate Crime Bill, which  the leader of the Scottish Conservatives has branded ridiculous, it is clear that they do not  agree with these issues been included as 'hate speech'.

In 2023 party conference speech, Sunak hails the benefits of Brexit.","As above. Speech says \"we must keep making the case for taking back control because if we don’t… our opponents will try and neuter this change\"","Sunak has hinted that he is willing to withdraw from the ECHR if it thwarts the Rwanda plan, but would only do so if necessary - more of a last resort than a positive policy. The Safety of Rwanda bill would make it possible.","In an interview in April 2024 Sunak defended his decision to keep supplying arms","\"Seeing the Rwanda plan through\" stated on homepage of website","Key election pledge","\"Stop the boats\" is one of the top 5 priorities","The current government explored this but a report published in 2021 concluded it would have negative consequences. Sunak has opposed recent changes to hate crime legislation in Scotland.","Sunak has launched a \"crackdown\" on retail crime but repeat offenders will be tagged rather than put in prison - they will only be imprisoned if they subsequently breach their community service order.","Sunak says he is still committed to reducing emissions but wants to adopt a more \"pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach\"","In a speech on 23 Sept 2023 Sunak says he will not ban  new oil and gas in the North Sea because it would make us reliant on Putin","Not mentioned in energy speech.

Unlikely to support as not in the Conservative Party's interests","Sunak has eased regulations on water quality as part of 'cutting red tape' post-Brexit. When asked about sewage in May 2023 he defended water companies and outlined other steps that were being taken to address the issue.","Cannot find any evidence to suggest the Conservatives are planning to stop Academies setting their own curriculum. Was not mentioned by the Education Secretary in a recent interview (Feb 24), which emphasised the autonomy of head teachers. Conservative party generally in favour of academies.","Sunak has spoken against LTNs and says he is \"on the side of drivers\", however a review of the scheme found that LTNs were popular.

Greens regret that the UK left the EU and they believe that the UK should rejoin, or at least rejoin the customes union so that some issues resulted by Brexit can be solved (part 9 on their webpage).","Eventhough the Green are opposed by the Common Foreign and Security Policy, it states that the UK should take a a positive role in developing and implementing a consensual common foreign policy under the CFSP (Part 5: EU Common Foreign and Security Policy).","Under part 10, it states that the Green are fully committed to the European convention on Human Rights. Also part 6 \"Human Rights\" section supports that the Greens are against withdrawal.","There isn't a direct say that the UK should stop selling arms to Israel, however it does say that de-escalation of the arms build-up in the region has to happen now.","There is no direct evidence on their webpage but they do mention that there needs to be a safe route for refugees and that the UK should welcome at least 10000 annually under the UN Resettlement Programme. However, on 11.December 2023 the Greens state that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda is inhumane and are very opposed and critical towards the government's agreement on this issue.","There isn't direct statement on this issue, however by reading the Greens policy on peace and defence I thinkt that they will disagree that there should be a mandatory national service as they don't believe that security can only be achieved by having military power.","There isn't a direct statement that the UK should accept more refugees from conflict zone. However when reading it is implied that the UK should accept refugees and treat them with respect","CJ350 states that hate crimes include crime motivated by hatred and discrimination based on ethnicity, colour, gender, trans, sexual orientation, religion, social origin, age, disability including learning difficulties or any other prejudice.","CJ340 states that there are too many people in prisons. Even though it doesn't directly say, the CJ340 indicates that The Greens would completely disagree that repeat offenders should be given mandatory sentences.","The Greens policy is very straight forward when it comes to zero targets and climate change. The UK should UK should target eliminating all carbon dioxide emissions within 10 years and that is why net zero targets cannot be abandoned.","Under the short term policies they state that the Supplementary Tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas producers will be raised, however it does not say directly stat the UK should stop exploiting the oilfields in the North Sea.","They state that there should a diversity of ownership of the energy system including public, municipal and community schemes. However, it does not say directly tgat the government should create a publicly-owned energy company.","Although they don't mention it directly, they emphasise that every citizen's basic right is to a decent wage, and at least minimum wage.","SW308: the Greens state that there should be a universal free childcare for children 1-6 years.","The Greens state that inheritance tax should be completely abolished as a result of Consolidated Income Tax.","EC1050: The Greens critisies the cutting of taxes as this will reduce money avaiable for improving public services.","They directly state that private school would be considered as buisness and will be taxed with VAT and Corporation Tax.","I couldn't find any direct evidence for this issue, however by reading the Greens policy on economy, I believe that the Greens would think the two-child benefit cap should be abolished as no child should live in poverty","They clearly state that the health care should be publically funded with no privatisaion.","The social housing needs to be increased, however no new homes are going to be built and that is why the party position is agree rather than completely agree.","RR531 states that trans, non-binary, genderqueer, third gender, and intersex people should have their gender legally recognised without medical or state encumbrance.","On page 11, The Greens clearly state that the First-Past-the-Post system needs to be replaced by Proportional Representation and Single Transferable Vote (STV).","On page 11, The Greens clearly state that the young people from the age of 16 should have the right to vote.","As the PL431 states that \"Individuals and organisations concerned with generating pollution will be held responsible for the costs of control and for any damage caused, however remote in time or distance. There will be no Crown immunity\". Eventhough it does not state that bossess of water companies shoud face criminal sanctions, the statement implies this.","The Greens believe that the national curriculum should be replaced and that learners and teachers should develop curriculum content to suit their needs and interests (ED041).","The Greens don't mention this specifically for England but more generally that the speed limit in residential areas should be 10mph (TR116).",null,null,null,"If the Welsh citizens decide to become an independent country they can do that via referendum.","The Greens state that the role of the Senedd/Welsh Parliament should increase (PA401).","They don't mention speed limit specifically in wales.

There is a minor mention that such rejoining would be contingent on the political environment and terms of return, but this is so ambiguous and outweighed by massive support for rejoining in the party policy programme.","The Greens support the diplomatic efforts of the EU only on competencies of environment, human rights, economics, and cultural exchange (EU211-5). The Greens want to reform the Council of Ministers to account for consent of each member state, and limit its competency to environment, rights, economic, trade, and diplomatic fields (EU322). The party explicitly rejects the CFSP, seeing the OSCE as the appropriate body for these issues (EU612, EU640). Overall, there is no complete disagreement because there is a role for the EU on some FP issues, but aiming to reform and reject the key institutions of foreign and security policy the Greens reject closer involvement with such institutions.","The party makes it very clear that they view the ECHR as \"The best structure at the European level through which to pursue basic human rights\" and wants to see the EU become a signatory (EU701-2 and EU1011-1012). The Greens completely disagree with the policy.","Following the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, the Greens \"repeated their call for the UK government to cancel all arms export licences to Israel\". The party cite Israel breaching the terms of these export licences and suggests a form of arms embargo. However, it is unclear about the timeframe of such a call, such as whether the Greens would be happy to resume arms exports in the long term if Israel stopped breaching licence terms. However, given wider commitment to curbing the arms trade, this is unlikely, so a completely agree code is given. \"We will diminish dependence on arms sales by ending all government subsidies and will introduce strict licensing regimes to stop military equipment being sent to regimes that violate human rights.\"","The Greens seek to repeal the Rwanda bill and express a preference for managing safe and legal routes for asylum seekers. The party completely disagrees with the Rwanda bill.","\"Green Party co-leader, Carla Denyer said the policy was 'removed from reality'. 'It's not what our military needs and it certainly isn’t what our young people need. 'What young people tell us they need is access to the housing market, to higher education that doesn’t plunge them into debt, and to meaningful jobs that pay well - not military conscription,' she said\". The Greens completely disagree with the policy.","The Greens political philosophy includes a world without borders (MG100) and for people to move where they wish. More specifically on those with refugee status, the Greens want to expand the definition of a refugee \"to include those forced to leave their homes by reason of “external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order\", with climate refugees included in this definition (RA102). This implies favouring expansion of those eligible to be welcomed in the UK with refugee status. Expansion would also cover those persecuted on grounds of protected characteristics and victims of human trafficking. One of the core objectives is also to \"establish a system of asylum and humanitarian protection (hereafter protection) which treats the applicant fairly and humanely and without discrimination\" (RA200). They completely agree with the policy.","The political programme unambiguously states that \"We will make misogyny a hate crime and make it easier to challenge media sexism\" (P13).","A core principle of the party is to keep the list of criminal behaviours as small as possible to focus on the social causes of crime, and that the current retributive model of sentencing as ineffective (CJ111-3). The objective is to \"intervene as minimally as the seriousness of the offence and the circumstance will allow\" (CJ205). In short, the focus is on crime prevention and not prison sentences, and reducing a list of crimes that are solved through prison (such as petty crimes). They completely disagree with the policy.","The Greens do not necessarily consider Net Zero in their programme because it falls short of their actual policy of achieving a zero-carbon society (CC107). However, the Greens actively hold government to account on decisions impacting the objective of the UK becoming Net Zero by 2050. In their 2022 conference policy statements there is inclusion of mandating financial institutions to help meet Net Zero. But again, the Greens objective goes further. This implies that net zero should not be abandoned, but indeed expanded, and so they completely disagree with abandoning the target.","In the immediate term, the Greens criticise the expansion of North Sea fossil fuel licenses. The short-term policy is to tax the profits of North Sea energy producers (EN131). The long-term aim is complete decarbonisation of the energy system, which would mean stopping exploitation of North Sea oil. However, in August 2023 the party announced an Earth Overshoot Action Plan which includes revoking all licences of energy extraction in the North Sea. However, this policy is not found in the main policy sections for the party. Overall, a completely agree code is given due to the criticism of North Sea oil and implied revoking of licenses through planned complete decarbonisation of the UK's energy mix.","The aim is to have public energy companies, which are \"democratic, locally owned networks for energy supply\" and thus shifting control from private energy companies. The operators of the energy grid appear to not be included, but the main emphasis is on the energy companies themselves so a completely agree is coded. The nationalisation of the five largest energy companies is mentioned as a short-term bridge policy (EN133), but the goal in the political programme indicates publicly owned local energy companies. Therefore, they completely agree with the policy.","This is inferred from previous policies from 2019 where the Greens \"make a commitment to extending the £12 living wage to those under the ages of 18, 21, and 25\". However, the Greens aim for a universal basic income for all citizens and enhanced minimum wage legislation (WR361). Although the Greens go further that restoring minimum wage parity, past policies imply equal entitlement to minimum wage for 18-20s.","Past policy announcements highlight plans to extend free childcare for all children aged over 9-months to 35 hours. The long-term goal is free childcare from ages 1-6. A completely disagree code is given since the Greens aim for extending free childcare.","On the one hand, the Greens aim to consolidate all income and wealth transfers, including Inheritance Tax, under a Consolidated Income tax. With their aim of universal basic income, this consolidate income and wealth would all be subject to tax as the tax-free allowance would cover just the universal basic income. As such, this implies that inheritance would be subject to more taxation than it currently is and would be a disagree code (EC722). On the other hand, the policy explicitly states that they will abolish inheritance tax and thus be an agree code (EC726). Because of the nature of the policy, I have given it a neither agree nor disagree code.","The Greens tax principles state that a reason for taxation is to fund public expenditure (EC700). The policy includes increasing taxation on unearned income (EC727), corporate tax rates (EC763) and eco taxes (EC771) etc. They unambiguously agree with them policy.","All private schools will have charitable status removed and would need to pay relevant VAT and Corporation taxes (ED127). This is a very unambiguous complete disagreement with the policy.","In October 2023 the Green party called for the two-child benefit cap to be scrapped in favour of reforming Universal Credit and introducing a wealth tax.","Privatisation of the NHS should not occur in any of its services, from administration, to support services and healthcare provision (HE104). The Greens also commit to reversing privatisation of ancillary services (HE1600). They are unambiguously against privatisation of the NHS.","Social housing must be expanded by increasing the share of new build housing to be social housing to over 50% and ending selloffs of existing stock (HO411). However, on the issue of greenfield sites there is a clear preference for any developments by local authorities to use existing empty buildings rather than developing greenfield sites. Indeed, in 2022 they noted a preference even for Brownfield sites, and although not completely barred, development on greenfield should be avoided. This qualifier reduces the code from a completely agree to just agree.","The policy is that \"trans, non-binary, genderqueer, third gender, and intersex people should have their gender legally recognised and be empowered to update their birth certificate and any other official documents, without medical or state encumbrance\". This is a very clear statement in support of the statement.","The Green's believe that a proportional representation voting system should be introduced to increase the importance of the UK Parliament and end the de-facto two party system (PA451 and PA459-60).","\"The voting age for all elections, and the age at which people may take seats at any level of Government, would be reduced to 16.\" (PA302). This is a very clear statement in support of the policy.","The Greens do not reference criminal sanctions on water companies but do support the issue. Caroline Lucas once criticised the government for reducing legal restrictions on water pollution, but no recent mention of legal repercussions has been made. Instead, they emphasis is on bringing water services into public ownership as part of their wider program of public ownership of utilities and services. It is hard to determine the position of the party, but because they make no (found) reference to criminal sanctions. because of the lack of support for the criminal sanctions component of the policy but overall sympathy for the approach, I code 'agree' (although a completely agree could be justified).","The Greens are opposed to creating more academies and Free Schools and seek to reintegrate existing Academies into the Local Authority school system (ED134). One of the reasons given for this policy is that Academies are free to set the curriculum and are thus not accountable to Local Authorities and the Secretary of State for Education (and are thus undemocratic) (ED130). By being opposed to Academies in the first place, the Greens are unambiguously in complete disagreement with their control over the curriculum.","There is no party wide policy on this issue although it can be inferred through its principles of \"streets for all\". This principle includes a 20mph limit in all built up areas and the use of traffic calming measures (policies that are LTNs in all but name) (TR113). The political programme also mentions clean air zones, a similar policy. However, on the level of local authorities the support for LTNs is far clearer, with campaigning for the policy in areas like Easling, Hackney, and Exeter. Despite no direct mention of the LTNs in the policy programme, the policies that are mentioned are similar to the LTNs whilst there is a clear party effort at the local level to implement, so a complete disagree code is given.",null,null,null,"The Green party in England and Wales as a whole believe that the constituent countries of the UK should have a degree of autonomy, and even independence should they wish to express their preference via referenda (PA401). The Wales Green Party are far more upfront with their preference, believing that \"an independent Wales is vital for creating a fairer, greener society\" and are actively part of the Welsh independence movement since at least 2022. There is therefore some minor split within the party as to commitment to Welsh independence, with the main party not averse to independence but on the condition of a referendum should the citizens of Wales choose one, whereas the Wales Greens are actively pro-independence. Because of this minor split that the main party having the qualifier, I code an agree code rather than completely agree code. A ‘completely disagree' code can also be justified.","The Green Party is unambiguous in its support for increasing the role of the Senedd (PA400), increased self-government (PA401), including in tax raising power (PA403).","Although there is no specific reference to 20 mph limits in residential areas in Wales found beyond the Wales Greens manifesto in 2016, the party is in general committed to \"a 20m.p.h. limit throughout built up areas, including villages\", which can be taken to mean across England and Wales (TR113).

Profits distributed abroad will be taxed. Finally a new Land Tax will be introduced. Finally, the Greens support a global minimum corporate tax rate but would increase it to at least 21%. In terms of spending the Greens call for public funds (either through taxation or, where necessary, public borrowing) to be used to build all new hospitals, schools and other public service infrastructure.","According to the Green Party website \"Schools which remain in the private sector would be classed as a business and have all charitable status removed; they would pay all relevant taxes such as VAT and Corporation Tax.\"","The Green Party advocates the scrapping of the scrap two-child benefit cap.","On 8th April 2024, the co-leader of the Green Party, Carla Denyer, criticised Wes Streeting's proposal for an increased role for the private sector in the NHS, saying that “The Green Party has never had any truck with the profit motive in health care and will continue to push for a fully publicly funded NHS.","While the Green Party recognise that there is a need for more affordable homes to meet local needs, most new homes should be provided in towns as more homes in town centres can contribute to their regeneration.

Tackling violence and women and girls is part of Labour's 'key mission' on safe streets but their current web page does not mention hate crime in this context.

I am proud that it was a Labour Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, who signed the human rights convention in 1950\". While in favour of the ECHR, Labour does not talk about it very much; hence the \"disagree\" code, rather than \"completely disagree\".","In May 2024 David Lammy has called on the government to halt arms exports to 'Israel' IF it goes ahead with a large-scale invasion of Rafah. This is rather conditional, so I would code \"neither agree nor disagree\".","Keir Starmer has said that Labour plans to cancel the Rwanda scheme \"straight away\" if it wins power.","Labour criticised the Tories' plans to bring back national service as \"desperate\" and \"unfunded\".","A report by the Fabian Society, dated February 2024 talks of the \"difficulty in pinning a potential Labour policy down\" on the migration issue in general. The emphasis is very much on clearing the Tory asylum backlog, and speeding up returns to safe countries, as well as cracking down on criminal trafficking gangs. The only concession is that they will \"safe family reunions for child refugees\". On 10th May 2024, Keir Starmer also said he would not commit to increasing the number of safe routes from other countries. I cannot see, therefore, that Labour would agree to accept MORE refugees from conflict zones.","In October 2023, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner pledged that the next Labour government will make misogyny a 'hate crime'. I go for \"agree\" rather than \"completely agree\" as it is not an issue that Labour emphasises.","\"Labour has vowed to change the law to stop shoplifters who steal goods worth less than £200 avoiding jail.\" Moreover, Labour aims to clamp down on shoplifting and violence against shopworkers, making it easier to take action against repeat offenders. According to the i newspaper \"Thousands of shoplifters are set to be spared jail under the government’s new policy of avoiding short prison sentences, despite an attempted crackdown on petty theft ...Labour described this as a 'get out of jail free card' for shoplifters.\"","\"Keir Starmer wants a potential Labour government to accelerate the transition to net zero as part of a Clean Energy Mission\"","Labour has vowed not to not to issue any new oil and gas licences if it wins power at July’s general election, although it will respect existing licences.","Labour wants to set up a new public company, branded Great British Energy, to be headquartered in Scotland. This is a flagship policy.","On the minimum wage, on its website Labour says it will \"remove the discriminatory age bands to ensure every adult worker benefits\" from the minimum wage.","Labour will back the childcare expansion plan being rolled out by the government if it wins the next general election. According to the plan, from September 2025 the third phase will see hours of free childcare doubled to 30 hours a week for eligible parents.","Rather than abolish inheritance tax, Labour actually wants to better enforce its collection. On 9 April 2024, Rachel Reeves, the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, indicated that Labour would not allow individuals to benefit from inheritance tax protection by establishing excluded property trusts before 6 April 2025.","Labour intends to pay for (modest) increases in public spending, e.g. on the NHS, teacher and police, by ending the VAT exemption for private schools and by extending the windfall tax on energy firms. They also pledge to close tax loopholes abolishing non-dam exemptions. However, they have also stated that there will be no rises in income tax or National Insurance and indeed shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said she wants \"taxes on working people to be lower\" and has not ruled out some spending cuts. So a bit of fence-sitting here.","The Labour Party has announced its intention to introduce VAT on private school fees. It is a flagship policy.","Keir Starmer has refused to pledge to abolish the cap, provoking criticism from some leading Labour figures, including Gordon Brown. Shadow Health secretary, Wes Streeting, said that he has voted against the two-child limit when it was introduced, \"so by definition, I wish it wasn't there\". However, he stressed that the state of the public finances meant there are \"harder choices to make\".","Labour has pledged plans to use the private sector to help cut the NHS care backlog.","According to Labour's website \"Labour is committed to prioritise building on brownfield land first, but we can’t build the homes that Britain needs without also releasing some greenbelt, including poor-quality land, car parks and wastelands currently classed as green belt.\" The website also states \"Labour’s housebuilding targets will see one and a half million new homes built within the first five years of a Labour government, delivering the biggest boost to affordable housing in a generation, creating new towns and ensuring first dibs for first-time buyers.\"","In 2023 Labour rowed back from its earlier policy that trans and non-binary people should be able to self-declare their gender without the need for a medical diagnosis. Now, while Labour pledges to \"modernise, simplify and reform the gender recognition law to a new process\", the party will still require a “medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria” as an “important” part of  obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate.","While the Labour Party Conference overwhelmingly backed proportional representation in its Autumn 2022 conference, in April 2023 Labour leader Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said he has a “longstanding view against proportional representation”. The party is therefore divided on this issue.","Sir Keir Starmer has said people old enough to work should be allowed to vote as he confirmed a Labour government would seek to extend the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds.","Labour's website asserts that Water bosses who oversee repeated law-breaking will face criminal charges.","According to Labour's policy paper, published in 2023 \"all state schools, including academies, will be required to teach the core national curriculum\" (p.9).","Anneliese Dodds, the Labour Party Chair, complains that \"the timing of the introduction of LTNs in cities like Oxford has underlined the lack of a joined-up approach to the issues\". However, many LTNs have been introduced by Labour local councils, and even by the (Labour) Welsh government.

membership is a long-term objective of the Lib Dems, with the immediate term policy being to rejoin initiatives such as Erasmus Plys and then the Single Market. Overall, the Lib Dems are pro-EU membership.","With commitment to the EU being clear, it can be implied this involves full involvement with European CFSP and other parts of the EU's security architecture. One mention of this in the party’s plan is \"Cooperating more closely with Britain’s NATO and EU partners in the joint development of innovative defence technologies\". The Lib Dem constitution also mentions that \"Within the European Community we affirm the values of federalism and integration and work for unity based on these principles\" indicating commitment to closer integration with EU structures including of FP and security (P2). Overall, a completely agree code is given despite no direct reference to these structures given overall support of the EU.","In their autumn 2023 conference, the Lib Dems unambiguously commit to the UKs membership of the ECHR.","The Lib Dems came out in favour of an immediate bilateral ceasefire in November. Following the IDF killing aid workers in Gaza, including three British citizens, party leader Ed Davey immediately \"called on the government to suspend arms sales to Israel\". No conditions are attached to the suspension of arms sales to Israel and so an unambiguous completely agree code is applied.","The Lib Dem plan is clearly against the current political debate on migration policy and favours safe and legal routes, including scrapping of the Illegal Migration Act. In 2022 following a High Court ruling deeming the Rwanda plan legal, the Lib Dems called the plan \"immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for taxpayers\". More recently, Lib Dem peers in the House of Lords organised to block the Safety of Rwanda bill. The actions and statements of Lib Dems over the policy in the last few years, as well as a preference for safe and legal routes, indicate the Lib Dems strongly disagree with the policy.","The Lib Dems are against cuts to Britain's armed forces. The Lib Dems have only limited interactions with the policy since its announcement, but one Lib Dem MP called it a \"desperate campaign announcement\" whilst Lib Dem councillors have warned that the plan would draw away young talent and funding from already deprived areas. Therefore, it can be inferred that the party is very much against the policy.","The Lib Dems want to provide safe and legal routes for asylum seeker and refugees. In March 2023 the Lib Dems at their conference articulated this policy to include expanding the resettlement scheme, a new scheme for unaccompanied child refugees reuniting unaccompanied children in Europe with family in the UK, and humanitarian visas. This implies acceptance of more refugees to the UK. Overall, the Lib Dems consistently talk of \"An expanded refugee resettlement scheme and the creation of humanitarian travel permits to undercut the people traffickers and help those fleeing war and violence\". Therefore, a clear completely agree code is given.","In the Lib Dem policy plan, there is a very clear line on this issue: \"Make misogyny a hate crime and give police and prosecutors the resources and training they need to prevent and prosecute all hate crimes while supporting survivors\". A completely agree code is given.","In late 2023 the Lib Dems introduced a policy on prison reform: \"The party has long called for comprehensive prison reform, including improving rehabilitation in prisons and on release, and introducing a presumption against short sentences\". Although not averse to prisons there is a preference for rehabilitation and moving away from short term prison sentences. The Lib Dems have been critical of the government introduced new laws which increase young people in short term prison sentences. The Lib Dems also have a history of alternative routes from prison for petty crimes, but less has been said more recently on the issue. On the issue of repeat offending, at the level of police and crime commissioners for the party there is a preference for rehabilitation in prison and community policing rather than mandatory prison sentences, although this may not reflect a country wide approach. However, overall, it can be inferred that despite not being averse to prison, the Lib Dems prefer rehabilitation and community approaches to petty crimes and even reoffending, warranting a completely disagree code. This is especially the case since the part is clearly against short term prison sentences.","The party's climate and energy policy make several references to Net Zero policy, commitment to meeting the goal by 2045, restructuring different levels of government to help achieve this objective, and promoting the goal in international trade agreements. Therefore, a completely disagree is coded.","Ed Davey has come out in opposition to expanding new oil and gas field development in the North Sea last September, instead favouring renewables. They have also criticised continued dependence on oil and gas. Therefore, the Lib Dems are against expansion of the North Sea energy extraction. However, they are more ambiguous on whether to stop exploiting it altogether, with no direct mention of such a stop. Given wider commitments to renewables and it's Net Zero targets, there is a clear indication the Lib Dems want to move away from fossil fuel extraction and thus lean on the side of agree. A 'neither' code could be applied because of the lack of direct references to halting extraction altogether, but I code 'agree' because of the wider context of Lib Dem preference for cutting fossil fuels.","The Lib Dems were first to propose a windfall tax on energy firms profiting from soaring energy prices and they propose to strengthen such taxes. However, they have not discussed public ownership of energy companies. Overall, they display no overall preference but do acknowledge the issue of energy companies. Because of this acknowledgement and lack of clear preference referring to public ownership, a 'neither' code is applied.","The only reference to minimum wage made by the Lib Dems is to increase the minimum wage for care workers, and to bring the wage for apprentices in line with actual minimum wage. Since low apprenticeship wages disproportionately impact you people, this could indicate improving the situation for 18–20-year-olds. However, this is no clear commitment to levelling the playing field for minimum wage and no clear priority is shown. Therefore, I code 'no opinion'.","The long-term goal is for free full-time childcare from aged two, and from 9 months for children with working parents. As a more concrete plan they seek to give children between 2-4 from disadvantaged families an extra 5 hours. Other policy commitments are also vague, such as \"Ensure that all parents can access childcare that is flexible, affordable and fair, including by reviewing the rates paid to providers for free hours to ensure they cover the actual costs of delivering high-quality childcare and early years education\". Because of the long-term commitment to full free childcare, it can be said that they party fully disagrees with the policy statement. The firm policy commitments also indicate this preference and show moving in the direction of more free hours for childcare. Therefore, a completely disagree code is given.","Lib Dem members have in the past proposed abolishing inheritance tax and instead taxing inheritance at income tax rates, which would indicate a 'neither' code due to it both increasing inheritance tax and abolishing it. However, this policy has not been adopted party wide. The tax pledges are largely targeting wealth rather than income (the latter being protected from tax raises). Inheritance tax would come under a wealth tax, yet there is no explicit mention of inheritance tax in the immediate term by the Lib Dems. Because the specifics of income tax are not mentioned, no policy position can be inferred from the above. Therefore, I code 'no opinion'.","One of the themes in the Lib Dem's 'Fair Deal' is for good access to public services. Part of their economic plan clearly states that \" We believe that strong public services are vital for the wellbeing of individuals and society as a whole. Fair and progressive taxation is vital to sustain the services that support our economy and society.\" As such there is a clear preference for public service over tax cuts. Concrete plans for taxes commit to being fairer to low earners, and to increase taxes on wealth and larger financial institutions: \"reversing the Conservatives’ tax cuts for big banks, and abolishing the separate Capital Gains tax-free allowance, to tax income from wealth more similarly to income from work\". At the same time, public spending will not exceed tax incomes in normal financial climates. All the above shows a clear preference for funding public services through taxation, and thus a code of 'completely agree' is applied.","Last September Ed Davey came out in opposition to Labour's plans to impose VAT in private schools, but they are open to reviewing their charitable status (which benefits private schools by offering lower tax rates). Therefore, they agree with the stated policy but are open to review in some instances. This an agree code is given. However, there has only been one prominent statement on this policy by the Lib Dems.","There are vague party commitments to \"raise legacy benefits\" but there is no direct reference to the two-child benefit cap. However, there have been calls to scrap the cap at the level of party membership and local party branches. The only direct reference to the cap is from Lib Dem MP Tim Farron to recommend the government in February 2023 to \"increase the child element of universal credit by at least £15 a week and abolish the benefit cap\". However, Tim Farron is no longer in the Lib Dem leadership and so cannot be taken as Lib Dem policy. Overall, it is clear that members of the party are sympathetic to lifting the two-child benefit cap. However, there is no concrete mention of the policy at the party level. Because there is some vague reference but not enough to infer direct preference or opposition to the policy, I code 'neither'.","Lib Dem policy priorities indicate a commitment to the NHS, with the only specific being reducing reliance on private dentistry. However, the party makes no reference to privatisation of the NHS, only to commit to a stronger NHS. We cannot infer a position on privatisation based on available statements and policies, and without specific mention, I code 'no opinion'.","The policy plan includes a clear commitment to rapid expansion and protection of social housing within a housebuilding programme: \"Building at least 150,000 new council and social homes a year, giving local authorities the powers to end the right to buy in their areas, and requiring them to have a landlord licensing scheme.\" On the issue of greenfield developments, there is no party wide position, yet it does appear that there is some contestation within the party over housebuilding targets. There also appears to be differentiation across Lib Dem local authorities’ approval of development on greenfield sites. Overall, there is a clear preference for expanding social housing yet reservations on the target numbers built and whether they can be built on greenfield. Therefore, an 'agree' code is given.","The Lib Dems state they \"Respect and defend the rights and identities of all LGBT+ people, including trans and non-binary people\". Historically they have also supported self ID without a medical diagnosis. Pink news describe the Lib Dems as having a good record on trans and non-binary rights. However, the outlet asked the Lib Dems about their current policy on gender recognition, with the response being the party aims to reform the gender recognition process to include non-binary people and to make it less bureaucratic and intrusive. This indicates that overall, the Lib Dems reject the current process and want to make it more progressive. Another piece of evidence is the Lib Dem support for Scotland's Gender Reform Bill, with all Lib Dem SMPs voting in favour of the bill which allows for self ID. From this statement, as well as historical support for LGBTQ+, the party would completely agree with the statement.","The Lib Dem policy plan is clearly in favour of PR: \"We will introduce proportional representation for electing MPs, and local councillors in England\". This also appears to be supported by the membership. A clear 'completely agree' code is given.","Ed Davey has recently come out in favour of Labour's plans to reduce the voting age to 16. However, this is not written formally by the party. At the same time, there is no opposition to the policy. Therefore, it can be inferred that the party completely agree with the policy.","Sewage discharge is an important part of the Lib Dem policy proposal: \"Ending sewage discharges by transforming water companies into public benefit companies, banning bonuses for water bosses until discharges and leaks end, and replacing Ofwat with a tough new regulator with new powers to prevent sewage dumps\". This statement indicates sanctions against water companies and more regulations protecting water systems from these companies. The party also tabled an amendment in the Criminal Justice Bill to criminalise water company bosses who fail to protect waterways from pollution. Overall, the Lib Dems appear to strongly support criminal sanctions for water company bosses who allow pollution.","Lib Dem education policies mostly focus on school repairs and free school meals. There is some move towards greater accountability of Academies to Ofsted, but no further information is given on specifics of the national curriculum. There are no references by the part or its MPs about Academies, and so I code 'no opinion'.","The Lib Dems commit to enhancing cycling and pedestrian networks to reduce traffic and emissions. The Lib Dems, who are more successful at council elections, have overseen LTN development in some constituencies, criticise failed implementation, and are overall supportive of them. Despite no direct reference to supporting widespread adoption of LTNs at the party level, it is clear they have a history of supporting and implementing the policy at the council level, which is where the policy has most impact. Therefore, I infer a completely disagree code.","The Lib Dem policy towards Scotland is \"Ensure a strong union with Scotland by opposing both a second independence referendum and independence\". This is an unambiguous rejection of Scottish independence.","The only relevant source notes that the Lib Dems joined three other parties in the Scottish Parliament to block the UK government's Genetic Technology Bill which would make remove some types of modified crops from the GMOP category (which is already banned in Scotland). This indicates that the Lib Dems seek to maintain the status quo of blocking GM crops in Scotland.","According to The Spectator, all five Scottish Lib Dem SMPs voted in favour of the legislation protecting sexual minorities and transgender people from hate speech (Hate Crime Act), although the outlet accuses the Lib Dems of \"not managed to find its voice on the issue lately\". However, it can be inferred from both their voting patterns and historic support for LGBTQ+ protections that the part does completely agree with the policy.","Welsh independence is not addressed by the Lib Dems. However, due to commitments to a strong union with Scotland, we can infer that the Lib Dems are also against Welsh independence.","There are no recent statements on devolution of powers to the Senedd by the Lib Dems. However, in the 2021 Welsh Lib Dem manifesto in 2021 they argue for a federal UK, going beyond devolution (P59). Further devolution of powers across the UK is also popular amongst the Lib Dem membership. The only other found mention of Welsh devolution comes from Ed Davey during the 2023. Despite limited recent mention of Welsh devolution, there is no indication of change since the 2021 declaration of support for a federal UK by the Welsh Lib Dems, so I code a strong disagree.","Ed Davey was interviewed and supports the 20mph policy but criticised it being applied as default. However, the leader of the Welsh Lib Dems Jane Dodds had to intervene to correct Ed Davey who incorrectly labelled the current policy as default, noting that local authorities have the final say on implementation. On the whole the national Lib Dems support the 20mph policy, as do the Welsh Lib Dems, who defend it in the Senedd. However, support for it being default is less clear since this is not the policy. Davey has shown disagreement with this part of the policy, whilst Dodds has not mentioned support for a default application of the policy. There have been instances on the local level of criticism of the implementation of the policy, which can be considered a blanket default approach, thus showing local level agreement in principle but disagreement with the 'blanket' part of the policy. Therefore, I code an 'agree' to account for the reservations about the default part of the policy.","The party has been pro-eu and anti-brexit all along and their website discusses building a closer relationship to the EU. It says 'Liberal Democrats are the UK’s most pro-European political party' and that their hope is to see Britain within Europe once more","The party seeks to work closely with Europe on international security issues. The second source is a little dated from 2022 but discusses a new approach to the UK-EU relationship on foreign and security policy stsating 'formal cooperation mechanisms on foreign and security policy issues, including regular ministerial meetings'. I imagine  this will be discussed more in the upcoming weeks.","The party urged the current government to 'unequivocally commit to staying in the European Convention on Human Rights' and discusses the importance of ECHR to protect human rights.","Ed Davey, party leader, has called for the government to suspend the sale of arms to Israel.","The party have deemed the Rwanda scheme immoral and have passed a new policy to scrap the scheme and prioritise creating safe and legal crossing for asylum seekers; https://www.libdems.org.uk/news/article/a-better-alternative-on-small-boats","The Lib Dems have branded national service a 'hare-brained' plan and argue that it would ruin the economy and say instead that they would reverse cuts to the army to create space for professionals to protect the country.","The website states that the party want to aid those fleeing war and ensure Britain offers sanctury for these individuals via safe and legal routes.","Following the Governments decision not to make misogyny a hate crime the Lib Dems the party stated 'we need the law to address that and address it now'. However, while the party have voiced their willingness for this I cannot find anything said recently on the issue or any information on how they plan to tackle sexism and misogyny or make it a hate crime.","Whilst there is a focus on rehabilitiation within some Welsh Lib Dem's promises during the Office of Police and Crime Commissioner in a plan to stop people reoffending and tackle prison overcrowding, I cannot see much else on the matter discussed recently.","The party wants to reach net zero by 2045 and have not discussed otherwise.","Lib Dems have proposed building a wind energy grid in the North Sea and the leader last year said that the Rosebank oil field should be blocked. In the Scottish leadership debate the Lib Dem candidate stated that the Government have not done enough to move away from fossil fuels. In saying this, they have not explicitly said that using oilfields in the North Sea should be stopped.","Whilst throughout the last election the Lib Dems manifesto discussed public ownership, within the past year they have turned focuus onto 'public benefit companies'. Due to the lack of discussion around public ownership recently I have put neither agree or disagree until we see their new manifesto.","The party have recently discussed the minimum wage for care workers but I cannot find anything on 18-20 year olds.","The party wants to create full time free childcare for those aged 2+. The Welsh Lib Dems have proposed 30 hours free childcare for those aged 9 months- 4 years old.","Can't find anything on this from recently","They plan to make tax 'fair' as opposed to promising tax cuts for all and discuss how they would  invest in public services so I feel they prioritise improvements over cutting taxes even if it has not been said outright.","Lib Dem's have spoken against Labour's plans to stop the tax breaks for private schools and argue that they have a right to exist. However, they have not said how they would handle the situation.","In an interview with sky Lib Dem leader called the 2 child tax cap 'bad' and says that ending it would be a priority for the party during the cost of living crisis.","Can't find specific discussion on this",null,"The party website explains trans rights well and states that whilst a medical diagnosis might be needed if individuals require medical interventions but self-declaring gender should be allowed if they do not.","The website calls for proportional representation","Leader Sir Ed Davey has welcomed Labour's plans to lower the voting age to 16 but not much else has been said on the matter",null,"Whilst the Lib Dem's have a large focus on children and education, I cannot find any mention of academies.","I cannot find anything from the overall party but a few local MPs have discussed the negative effects of LTNs.","Scottish Lib Dem leader Alec Cole-Hamilton has said that 'nobody cares' in Scotland about another independence referendum and that his party do not want independence for Scotland","Can't find anything from the Lib Dem's on this past 2004.","I cannot find anything within the past year or two to say this exactly but the party are vocal about LGBTQ+ rights and therefore, whilst this has not been said since their last manifesto, I have assumed they would support this.","This source discusses that Welsh independence has a 45% backing amongst the Welsh Lib Dem's but the leaders don't seem to discuss it so it is difficult to capture the parties overall view.","At the Lib Dem conference 2023 they noted that the Crown Estate should be devolved to Wales but have not discussed any other further devolution in Wales recently","The party argues that while the implementation lacked consultation with local communities, the 20mph limit has positve impacts in some built up areas.","States their long-term objective is to rejoin EU","States working more closely with EU & NATO on development of defence technology","Human rights as a central value, put it at the heart of trade by banning imports from countries violating human rights","Ed Davey calls for suspension after death of support workers - April 2024","Want to scrap the policy entirely.

This, together with their eventual goal of rejoining the EU would, suggest that this is a policy that they would agree with. Moreover a motion to the LibDem conference in autumn 2022 proposed by LibDem foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran laments the \"UK's failure to take part in EU foreign and security policy schemes”.","In the LibDem Conference in Autumn 2023 a motion was passed on \"Protecting the European Convention on Human Rights\" against what LibDems see as an attack on it by some Tories.","On 3rd April 2024, the Liberal Democrats and their leader Ed Davy called on the government to suspend arms sales to Israel, following the deaths of seven aid workers including three British nationals in an Israeli air strike in Gaza. As the word used is the milder \"suspend\", I am coding this \"Agree\", rather than \"Completely Agree\"","The LibDems describe the Rwanda scheme as \"immoral, unworkable and extortionately expensive for the taxpayer\" and destined to fail. They pledge to scrap it.","The LibDems described the Tories’ plan to bring back national service as a \"reheated announcement\" that \"shows the Conservatives are out of ideas and deserve to be kicked out office”.

This includes how much has been spent on prison sentences of 6 months or less since 2019, when the plans to scrap short sentences were first abandoned. The party has long called for comprehensive prison reform, including improving rehabilitation in prisons and on release, and introducing a presumption against short sentences.\" However, at the same time LibDem Home Affairs spokesperson said that \"shopkeepers are being abandoned while criminals are allowed to act with impunity\". On balance, given the parties tendency towards prison reform, I'd assume a \"disagree\", but the evidence is rather weak.","On the LibDem website: \"Climate change is the biggest threat to human existence ... The war in Ukraine has reinforced the need to significantly reduce Britain’s dependence on fossil fuels and grow the renewables sector in order to enhance energy security and achieve net zero.\"","According to the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, the planned Rosebank oil and gas field development off Shetland, which is the UK's largest untapped oil field, should not go ahead. Davey told BBC Scotland News the focus should instead be on renewables and insulating homes.","Wera Hobhouse, the spokesperson for Energy, Climate Change and Transport for the LibDems, while critical of the giant energy companies does not propose a single publicly-owned energy company, but instead proposes giving local authorities more power to build community renewable energy. They also aim to restructure national and local government to deliver net zero by creating a Net Zero Delivery Authority and strengthening the powers and resources of local authorities to cut emissions in their area, and promote community energy. This seems to be a move towards some form of public ownership, but one rather different from that implied by the policy item. I therefore suggest \"neither agree nor disagree\".","All I could find is a VERY old policy document (dated 2016) that states \"Young people earning the National Minimum Wage are paid less than others doing the same job. We believe that wages should reflect the role of the job and the skills required by the individual, not their age. We will therefore equalise the National Minimum Wage across all ages. I would therefore code \"agree\" but I lack confidence in this.","According to Munira Wilson, the LibDem spokesperson for education, the LibDems have a long-term commitment to delivering free, full-time childcare for all children from age two and those with working parents from nine months. They also aim to give disadvantaged children aged two to four with an additional five free hours a week.","In September 2023 LibDem leader Ed Davey said his party would not look to reduce or remove inheritance tax after reports this weekend claimed it was a move being considered by Rishi Sunak ahead of the next election.","While the LibDems ditched a pledge to put 1p on income tax to pay for public services in September 2023, they instead seem to be talking about taxing large corporation more to fund their plans. They also say they'll increase taxes on social media giants to fund mental health professionals in schools. They have not really talked about CUTTING taxes.","In September 2023 the Liberal Democrats have said that they would not support Labour's policy of imposing VAT on private school fees.","In an article dating to February 2024, the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors stated that \"The Liberal Democrats have consistently opposed this policy. ...

A report in the i newspaper dated May2023 states that \"They haven’t quite decided yet\". Similarly, they have have denied reports that plans to build more homes on green belt would be a \"red line\" for the party if it went into coalition with Labour.","According to Edinburgh West LibDem MP Christine Jardine,  the party is committed to reforming the gender recognition process to make it “less bureaucratic and intrusive” and to include non-binary people.

Islington Liberal Democrats have said they would hold ‘Citizens’ Assemblies’ to allow resident views to be properly assessed before LTN schemes are brought in. LibDems also acknowledge that LTNs sometimes fail to take the interests of older and disabled people into account.

Despite limited recent mention of Welsh devolution, there is no indication of change since the 2021 declaration of support for a federal UK by the Welsh Lib Dems, so I code a strong disagree."],"Comment":[null]},"columns":[{"id":"Source","name":"Source","type":"character"},{"id":"Justification","name":"Justification","type":"character"},{"id":"Comment","name":"Comment","type":"character"}],"bordered":true,"compact":true,"dataKey":"4387926e66374e1cf07dc1ea3cb4bfff","static":false,"nested":true},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"padding":"16px","margin-top":"-10px","margin-bottom":"-10px"}},"children":[{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Source":["https://www.libdems.org.uk/news/article/twentys-plenty-20-conservative-politicians-and-councils-who-backed-20-mph-zones; https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-66865818; https://www.theyworkforyou.com/senedd/?id=2023-06-28.8.515924.h; https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/23855171.call-20mph-limits-cardiff-scrapped-rejected/"],"Justification":["Ed Davey was interviewed and supports the 20mph policy but criticised it being applied as default.

Davey has shown disagreement with this part of the policy, whilst Dodds has not mentioned support for a default application of the policy.

The Lib Dems have been critical of the government introduced new laws which increase young people in short term prison sentences. The Lib Dems also have a history of alternative routes from prison for petty crimes, but less has been said more recently on the issue. On the issue of repeat offending, at the level of police and crime commissioners for the party there is a preference for rehabilitation in prison and community policing rather than mandatory prison sentences, although this may not reflect a country wide approach.

Given wider commitments to renewables and it's Net Zero targets, there is a clear indication the Lib Dems want to move away from fossil fuel extraction and thus lean on the side of agree.

Concrete plans for taxes commit to being fairer to low earners, and to increase taxes on wealth and larger financial institutions: \"reversing the Conservatives’ tax cuts for big banks, and abolishing the separate Capital Gains tax-free allowance, to tax income from wealth more similarly to income from work\".

Reform Party manifesto has a Brexit specific section, which states that \"Brexit is a great opportunity\", which meant \"taking back control\". It then lists opportunities given by Brexit, of which the Reform Party wants to take advantage of.","Whilst the Reform Party don't specifically mention the EU Foreign Affairs Council, they are clear that they want very little involvement with the EU, including scrapping EU legislation, leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, and leaving the EU Horizon Program.","Their manifesto states that Britain must \"leave the European Convention on Human Rights\", and that if successful at election, this would be a critical reform actioned with \"the first 100 days\".","Whilst I struggled to find anything specific on their manifesto relating to the selling of arms to Israel, Nigel Farage, the leader of the Reform Party, has been vocal in his support to Israel, and has denounced the \"growing prejudice against Israel\". He has consistently supported Israels 'right to exist', and denounced the International Criminal Court for their arrest warrant issued for Netenyahu. Ex-Leader Richard Tice has similar views, stating his support for Israel to \"defend itself against attack\" and that the UK must stand \"rock solid in supporting this right\".","The Reform Party are steadfast in their view of limiting immigration to the UK, which includes asylum seekers arriving on small boats, declaring them a \"national security threat\". However, Reform Party leader Nigel Farage has stated that the plan to deport some aslyum seekers to Rwanda as something that \"won't work\", and that instead the Reform Party would return asylum seekers to France.","Reform Party Leader Nigel Farage has branded the Conservative Party policy of mandatory National Service as a \"joke\" and \"totally impractical\".","The Reform Party are very much against accepting more refugees from conflict zones, particularly if those refugees enter the UK via 'small boat' crossings of the channel. The Party have states that they want to freeze all immigration, with exceptions to those with \"essential skills\" such as nurses. The party manifesto denounces the \"record number of asylum claims\", stating that this has led to lower wages, the housing crisis and longer NHS waiting lists.","Whilst I struggled to find anything specific on the Reform Party and their views on misogyny/sexism as a hate crime, the Reform Party, in their manifesto, have stated that they want to end \"woke policing. Nigel Farage has come out against Scotlands new hate crime laws, which expands the definition of what is defined as a hate crime. Their maifesto also references that \"members of the British public must not be investigated because 'any' person 'perceives' a hate crime has been commited. Therefore it's reasonable to believe they wouldn't support crimes being motivated by sexism/misogyny being treated as hate crimes.","The Reform Party haven't publicly stated an opinion on whether repeat offenders of petty crimes deserve mandatory jail time, the reform party are committed to increasing the number of prison places, as well as introducing mandatory sentencing for those involved in several instances of violent crime.","Clearly specified in their manifesto, which states that if elected, the Reform Party would \"scrap net zero and related subsidies\".","The Reform Party state that they want \"cheap, secure energy\" for the UK, and that if elected, they would \"start fast track licences of North Sea gas and oil\".","The reform party wish to end the control of energy/water firms by foreign companies, and instead propose that 50% of such companies should be owned by the government, and 50% by British pension funds. This is part of the Reform Party plan to strengthen UK energy security.","Cannot find any information on the Reform Partys opinion on this issue.","Cannot find any information on the Reform Partys opinion on this issue.","The manifesto clearly states that the reform party believe that the 'grief tax' should be abolished for all estates under £2m, with only those above that amount being taxed 20%.","The Reform Party advocate for lower taxes, stating that \"smart tax cuts greate growth and pay for themselves\", which means \"more money to invest in reformed public services\".","The reform party manifesto states that they believe in \"tax relief of 20% on all independent education\", and that parents should be incentivised to choose independent schools.","Cannot find any information on the Reform Partys opinion on this issue.","The Reform party advocate in their manifesto for cutting waiting lists by using UK and overseas providers, including both for and non-profit health providers.","The Reform Party acknowledge the need for more social housing, but do not mention the use of building on greenfield sites, instead stating that planning should be fast tracked and there should be tax incentives for developing brownfield sites.","Several prominent members of the Reform Party have stated that they would not support self-id, and wish to ban-transgender ideology from primary and secondary schools, stating \"there are 2 sexes and 2 genders. It is a dangerous safeguarding issue to confuse children by suggesting otherwise. No gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping\".","The Reform Party Manifesto specifically states that Proportional Representation should be introduced in the House of Commons, calling the system \"outdated\", and that by introducing PR, the voting system in the UK would be more representational and that turnout in elections would improve.","Whilst I can't find information on the view of the Reform Party on this matter, leader Nigel Farage has opposed lowering the voting age in the past, stating that if you cannot stand as a candidate at 16, you shouldn't be able to vote at 16.","The Reform Party have stated that the water grid should be nationalised, and wish to prevent water companies from releasing sewage into the river and seas, with ex-leader Richard Tice stating that regulators were \"asleep at the wheel\" on the matter. Some of their more prominent candidates have supported prosecuting water company bosses for polluting the UKs water. However, I have struggled to find views of the Reform Party overall, or their leadership, on the prosecution of water bosses.","Cannot find any information on the Reform Partys opinion on this issue.","The Reform Party manifesto clearly states that they would legislate to ban low traffic neighbourhoods.","Whilst not in their manifesto, leader Nigel Farage has been consistently against Scottish Independence, and has disagreed with the idea of a second referendum on Scottish independence, stating that the 2016 referendum was \"once in a lifetime\", and that he \"doesn't believe independence is the best thing for Scotland\". He has on other occasions called the Scottish Independence movement \"Anti-English\" and \"unpleasant and nasty\".","Cannot find any information on the Reform Partys opinion on this issue.","The Reform Party would change the definition of a hate crime, stating that the current definitions lead to systemic bias, and that \"Members of the British public must not be investigated because ‘any’ person ‘perceives’ that a hate crime has been committed\". The Reform Party has also come out against Scotlands new hate crime laws, which expand the definition of hate crimes to include, amongst others, hate speech against sexual minorities and transgender people.","I can't find any information on the Reform Partys opinion on Welsh independence, though they have been strong in their support for Scotland remaining part of the UK, so it's reasonable to believe that their opinions on Welsh independence could be similar. As I cannot back this up with a source, I have written 'no opinion'.","Prominent members of Reform Party have stated in the past that \"devolution doesn't work at any level\". However, in the past, Nigel Farage has stated that England needs devolved powers, and wanted MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to not be able to take part in England specific debates in the House of Commons. Therefore, I'm not confident of the Reform Partys opinion on this issue.","Cannot find any information on the Reform Partys opinion on this issue, however they are opposed to policies such as low traffic neighbourhoods and ULEZ, so it's reasonable to believe they would oppose a 20mph speed limit. As I cannot back this up with a source, I have written 'no opinion' on this.","Brexit is a great opportunity for which the government has so far failed to take advantage'.","Independence for Britain's armed forces`.","Leave the European Convention on Human Rights'.","Former Reform leader Tice argued that 'Israel absolutely has the right to defend itself against attack and the UK must stand rock solid in supporting this right'.","Farage said the government’s proposals to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda “doesn’t work” and “until we leave the European Court of Human Rights we will never be able to solve” the issue of people crossing the Channel on small boats.","Reform are yet to outrightly declare an opinion on this from what I have researched.","Farage has previously suggested that he is 'open minded' and understands understands refugees from conflict zones are 'genuinely' refugees. However, Reform UK also want to 'take control back control of our borders'.","The definition of hate crime would be changed in order to require “proper evidence”. 'Members of the British public must not be investigated because any person percieves that a hate crime has been committed'.","“Zero tolerance” policing.","scrap net zero'.","start fast track licenses of North Sea gas and oil'.","Launch a new model that brings 50% of each utility into public ownership. The other 50% would be owned by UK pension funds, benefiting from new expertise and better management'.","The party has not expressed an opinion on this specifically, hence the uncertainty in the party position and the confidence ranking.","Frontloading the Child benefit system for children ages 1-4'. This would give parents the choice to spend more time with their children.","Inheritance tax would be “abolished” for all estates worth under £2 million","Raise the minimum income tax threshold from £12,571 to £20,000', 'reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25 per cent to 20 per cent'.","Tax relief on 20% on all independent education'.","The party have not indicated their position on this.","NHS patients would receive a voucher for fully-funded private treatment if they could not see a GP within three days, a consultant within three weeks, or have an operation in nine weeks.","Reform social housing',","There are 2 sexes and 2 genders'.","proportional representation voting in the House of Commons`","If you are not allowed to stand in the election as a candidate, you should not be allowed to vote'","Stop the release of sewage into our rivers and seas'","The party has stated that it would place a greater emphasis on life skills by adding Home Economics and classes about the risks of social media to the national curriculum, however it has not stated whether academies should continue to set their own curriculum.","Legislate to ban all ULEZ and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods'.","Reform UK generally see the devolved nations as having a place within the United Kingdom so one would expect for them to disagree with pledges for independence.","Future technology and fertiliser supplies'","There are 2 sexes and 2 genders'.","Reform UK generally see the devolved nations as having a place within the United Kingdom so one would expect for them to disagree with pledges for independence.","“Devolution Doesn’t Work At Any Level” Says Reform UK Deputy Leader Ben Habib","Nigel Farage argued that plans to introduce a 20mph speed limit in Welsh residential areas is part of an “anti-motorist racket”.","Believe that Brexit is a great oppertunity to take back control of british borders, laws and money.","Britain should leave EU Horizion programme. Britain's armed forces should be independant.","British laws and judges must never be overruled by a foreign court.","Rishard Tice stated on facebook \"Israel absolutely has the right to defend itself against attack and the UK must stand rock solid in supporting this right.\"","Immigrants should be sent back across the channel to France not to Rwanda. Tice also stated this when interviewed by LBC.","Reform UK leader Richard Tice said the plan suggested by Rishi Sunak was “completely unworkable”.","Wish to freeze 'non-essential' immigration. Only wish to accept immigrants with skills needed by British state, e.g. doctors, nurses.","Common Sense Policing not ‘Woke’ Policing.

Also contains many Scottish candidates who voted for Scottish Independance in 2014.","Future technology & fertiliser supplies.

This would suggest that the party is strongly pro-Israel and would not approve of an arms boycott.","On X (formerly Twitter), Reform UK posted on May 25th \"It is crystal clear the Toxic Tories’ Rwanda farce is not working.\" The party instead proposes to deport all those arriving in small boats back to France.","Honorary president of Reform UK, Nigel Farage tweeted on 26th May: \"Does anyone really think that Sunak believes in National Service? This is more Tory lies. He is following focus groups instead of being a leader. A diminished armed forces could not carry it out & many that he’s allowed into our country would refuse to do it in the first place.\" Party leader Richard Tice, however, said that that there is \"merit and mileage\" in a national contribution from young people (a \"civic duty\") if it was carefully thought out, but the Tories' idea came from the back of a fag packet.","Reform UK pledges to freeze non-essential immigration and to provide secure detention for all asylum seekers offshore. In April 2024, Reform UK deputy leader, Ben Habib, even suggested that Britain should let migrants drown in the Channel.","Reform UK's utterances would suggest that it strongly disagrees with this statement. On its website the party states that \"the CPS and police definition of a hate crime has led to systemic bias. Members of the British public must not be investigated because ‘any’ person ‘perceives’ that a hate crime has been committed.\"","On March 28 2024, Reform UK leader Richard Tice tweeted \"Shoplifting in Britain: Stolen, then on Facebook minutes later. Another sign of Tories’ Broken Britain that Labour will not stop. Only @reformparty_uk will have zero tolerance approach to this criminality.\" Reform UK also plans to \"commence building of 10,000 new detention places\". While I can find not direct evidence on the punishments Reform UK plans for shoplifters, the implication is that imprisonment would be a favoured option.","On the party website it says \"Westminster’s obsession with Net Zero is damaging our livelihoods and the economy. ... Net Zero sends our money abroad and damages critical industries like steel production.","The party plans to \"Start fast-track licences of North Sea gas and oil.\"","Under a proposal from Reform UK leader Richard Tice, companies supplying and distributing energy and water would continue to be run by private firms. However 50% would be owned by the government. So a half-way house.","I can find no evidence of the party’s position on this issue.","While there seems to be no explicit policy in this, the emphasis of Reform UK's policies would seem to be on parents (mainly mothers) staying at home looking after kids. The website states \"The majority of mothers would choose to stay at home more if they could. ‘Frontloading’ the Child Benefit system for children aged 1-4 would give parents the choice to spend more time with their children.\" This leads me to suspect that the party will reject extending out-of-family childcare.","The party plans to abolish inheritance tax for estates worth less than £2m.","Reform UK plans to cut a whole raft of personal taxes, by raising thresholds for income tax, cutting energy taxes, stamp duties and inheritance tax. The party also plans to \"Slash wasteful Government spending\". The priority clearly lies with tax cuts.","The party's website states \"No VAT on Fees: If parents can afford to pay a bit more, we should incentivise them to choose independent schools.\"","While Reform UK would ‘frontload’ Child Benefit system for children aged 1-4, there is no mention of what they would do to the two-child benefit cap (see above).","The party aims to \"use independent healthcare capacity ... to end the NHS crisis\".","The party wants to \"fast track planning and tax incentives for development of brownfield sites, including unused offices and vacant high street properties\", but does not extend this to Greenfield sites. Reform UK spokesperson Anne Widdecombe said “There's plenty of brownfield sites around us,\" she said. \"Where I live, which is in a national park, there's still a lot of building in surrounding villages, and none of that is on green fields. We will be looking at all options but the main option will not be greenfield.”","Pink News: \"It’s safe to say that the Reform UK doesn’t support self-ID for trans people. The right-wing populist party, known for its anti-immigration stance, hasn’t directly spoken about subject but has campaigned to ban lessons on gender in schools and implement “single-sex” spaces such as public toilets.\"","The party's website pledges \"Proportional Representation Voting for the House of Commons: First Past the Post is an outdated voting system.\"","The absence of this issue in the list of constitutional reforms showcased on the party website would lead me to suspect that Reform UK opposes reducing the voting age.","Speaking about the Isle of Wight, Reform UK leader Richard Tice said \"Islanders are also more exposed to the harms of the water companies contaminating our rivers and seas. Besides the serious harms to health and the environment, it also has a direct impact on tourism. The Island economy is heavily reliant on this sector, and those responsible should be held to account for their mismanagement and dangerous decision making.\" This suggests, but does not say explicitly that they should be held criminally responsible.","Back in 2008, Reform UK leader Richard Tice wrote a paper on his experience as Chair of Governors at Northampton Academy. He praised the \"application of the management independence of the academy model\" and lamented the \"restraints of the National Curriculum and over-testing\" saying the National Curriculum \"has become too prescriptive, stifling teachers’ and pupils’ creativity\".","The party's website pledges to \"legislate to ban all ULEZ and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods\".","Reform UK Scotland insists that \"Scotland maintains its rightful place as a full and respected member of the United Kingdom”.","The party appears to say nothing about GM crops.","The party wants to weaken the definition of hate crime. In its website it states \"The CPS and police definition of a hate crime has led to systemic bias. Members of the British public must not be investigated because ‘any’ person ‘perceives’ that a hate crime has been committed.\" The party is also strongly anti-trans, advocating \"banning transgender ideology in schools\" and \"no gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping\". It also claims \"there are 2 sexes and 2 genders\" and that \"divisive laws promote minority interests over the majority\".","In its 2021 manifesto for the elections to the Senedd in Wales, Reform UK pledged to \"actively campaign to remain a firm member of the United Kingdom.\"","According to the party's 2021 manifesto for elections to the Senedd, the party would \"oppose any increase in the number of MSs. We believe in reducing the number of paid politicians in Wales, and would advocate using the 40 Westminster MPs that represent Wales to scrutinise the Welsh Government.\" The manifesto also pledged to \"devolve some powers of Welsh Government to Local Authorities, bringing them closer to the people\".","According to the party, \"Wales does not need a 20mph speed limit for all residential roads\"."],"Comment":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Reform have stated that they wish to legislate to scrap EU regulations and abandon the Windor framework as a means to move away from the EU further.","Reform have stated that they want independence from the EU Horizon programme suggesting that they would be unlikely to draw closer to the EU on security issues.","Reform argue that 'British laws and judges must never be overruled by a foreign court' and believe strongly in leaving the ECHR.","The party's overall view on this is uncertain however one can suggest given Tice's opinion, while being leader, that Reform would be likely to disagree with statement 4.","The party position has been labelled as such due to the fact that Reform UK do believe in 'stopping the boats' with a '6 point plan', however they are not statisfied that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda without leaving the ECHR would work.","Given the political leaning and overarching ideology, one can expect for Reform to potentially agree with this statement but given the lack of evidence this is still uncertain.","Reform has been critical of the Conservative government on immigration and are calling for tougher rules.
