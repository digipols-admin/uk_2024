email evidence.","Private email evidence.","https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-66865818"],"Justification":["EU membership is a long-term objective of the Lib Dems, with the immediate term policy being to rejoin initiatives such as Erasmus Plys and then the Single Market. Overall, the Lib Dems are pro-EU membership.","With commitment to the EU being clear, it can be implied this involves full involvement with European CFSP and other parts of the EU's security architecture. One mention of this in the party’s plan is \"Cooperating more closely with Britain’s NATO and EU partners in the joint development of innovative defence technologies\". The Lib Dem constitution also mentions that \"Within the European Community we affirm the values of federalism and integration and work for unity based on these principles\" indicating commitment to closer integration with EU structures including of FP and security (P2). Overall, a completely agree code is given despite no direct reference to these structures given overall support of the EU.","In their autumn 2023 conference, the Lib Dems unambiguously commit to the UKs membership of the ECHR.","The Lib Dems came out in favour of an immediate bilateral ceasefire in November. Following the IDF killing aid workers in Gaza, including three British citizens, party leader Ed Davey immediately \"called on the government to suspend arms sales to Israel\". No conditions are attached to the suspension of arms sales to Israel and so an unambiguous completely agree code is applied.","The Lib Dem plan is clearly against the current political debate on migration policy and favours safe and legal routes, including scrapping of the Illegal Migration Act. In 2022 following a High Court ruling deeming the Rwanda plan legal, the Lib Dems called the plan \"immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for taxpayers\". More recently, Lib Dem peers in the House of Lords organised to block the Safety of Rwanda bill. The actions and statements of Lib Dems over the policy in the last few years, as well as a preference for safe and legal routes, indicate the Lib Dems strongly disagree with the policy.","The Lib Dems are against cuts to Britain's armed forces. The Lib Dems have only limited interactions with the policy since its announcement, but one Lib Dem MP called it a \"desperate campaign announcement\" whilst Lib Dem councillors have warned that the plan would draw away young talent and funding from already deprived areas. Therefore, it can be inferred that the party is very much against the policy.","The Lib Dems want to provide safe and legal routes for asylum seeker and refugees. In March 2023 the Lib Dems at their conference articulated this policy to include expanding the resettlement scheme, a new scheme for unaccompanied child refugees reuniting unaccompanied children in Europe with family in the UK, and humanitarian visas. This implies acceptance of more refugees to the UK. Overall, the Lib Dems consistently talk of \"An expanded refugee resettlement scheme and the creation of humanitarian travel permits to undercut the people traffickers and help those fleeing war and violence\". Therefore, a clear completely agree code is given.","In the Lib Dem policy plan, there is a very clear line on this issue: \"Make misogyny a hate crime and give police and prosecutors the resources and training they need to prevent and prosecute all hate crimes while supporting survivors\". A completely agree code is given.","In late 2023 the Lib Dems introduced a policy on prison reform: \"The party has long called for comprehensive prison reform, including improving rehabilitation in prisons and on release, and introducing a presumption against short sentences\". Although not averse to prisons there is a preference for rehabilitation and moving away from short term prison sentences. The Lib Dems have been critical of the government introduced new laws which increase young people in short term prison sentences. The Lib Dems also have a history of alternative routes from prison for petty crimes, but less has been said more recently on the issue. On the issue of repeat offending, at the level of police and crime commissioners for the party there is a preference for rehabilitation in prison and community policing rather than mandatory prison sentences, although this may not reflect a country wide approach. However, overall, it can be inferred that despite not being averse to prison, the Lib Dems prefer rehabilitation and community approaches to petty crimes and even reoffending, warranting a completely disagree code. This is especially the case since the part is clearly against short term prison sentences.","The party's climate and energy policy make several references to Net Zero policy, commitment to meeting the goal by 2045, restructuring different levels of government to help achieve this objective, and promoting the goal in international trade agreements. Therefore, a completely disagree is coded.","Ed Davey has come out in opposition to expanding new oil and gas field development in the North Sea last September, instead favouring renewables. They have also criticised continued dependence on oil and gas. Therefore, the Lib Dems are against expansion of the North Sea energy extraction. However, they are more ambiguous on whether to stop exploiting it altogether, with no direct mention of such a stop. Given wider commitments to renewables and it's Net Zero targets, there is a clear indication the Lib Dems want to move away from fossil fuel extraction and thus lean on the side of agree. A 'neither' code could be applied because of the lack of direct references to halting extraction altogether, but I code 'agree' because of the wider context of Lib Dem preference for cutting fossil fuels.","The Lib Dems were first to propose a windfall tax on energy firms profiting from soaring energy prices and they propose to strengthen such taxes. However, they have not discussed public ownership of energy companies. Overall, they display no overall preference but do acknowledge the issue of energy companies. Because of this acknowledgement and lack of clear preference referring to public ownership, a 'neither' code is applied.","The only reference to minimum wage made by the Lib Dems is to increase the minimum wage for care workers, and to bring the wage for apprentices in line with actual minimum wage. Since low apprenticeship wages disproportionately impact you people, this could indicate improving the situation for 18–20-year-olds. However, this is no clear commitment to levelling the playing field for minimum wage and no clear priority is shown. Therefore, I code 'no opinion'.","The long-term goal is for free full-time childcare from aged two, and from 9 months for children with working parents. As a more concrete plan they seek to give children between 2-4 from disadvantaged families an extra 5 hours. Other policy commitments are also vague, such as \"Ensure that all parents can access childcare that is flexible, affordable and fair, including by reviewing the rates paid to providers for free hours to ensure they cover the actual costs of delivering high-quality childcare and early years education\". Because of the long-term commitment to full free childcare, it can be said that they party fully disagrees with the policy statement. The firm policy commitments also indicate this preference and show moving in the direction of more free hours for childcare. Therefore, a completely disagree code is given.","Lib Dem members have in the past proposed abolishing inheritance tax and instead taxing inheritance at income tax rates, which would indicate a 'neither' code due to it both increasing inheritance tax and abolishing it. However, this policy has not been adopted party wide. The tax pledges are largely targeting wealth rather than income (the latter being protected from tax raises). Inheritance tax would come under a wealth tax, yet there is no explicit mention of inheritance tax in the immediate term by the Lib Dems. Because the specifics of income tax are not mentioned, no policy position can be inferred from the above. Therefore, I code 'no opinion'.","One of the themes in the Lib Dem's 'Fair Deal' is for good access to public services. Part of their economic plan clearly states that \" We believe that strong public services are vital for the wellbeing of individuals and society as a whole. Fair and progressive taxation is vital to sustain the services that support our economy and society.\" As such there is a clear preference for public service over tax cuts. Concrete plans for taxes commit to being fairer to low earners, and to increase taxes on wealth and larger financial institutions: \"reversing the Conservatives’ tax cuts for big banks, and abolishing the separate Capital Gains tax-free allowance, to tax income from wealth more similarly to income from work\". At the same time, public spending will not exceed tax incomes in normal financial climates. All the above shows a clear preference for funding public services through taxation, and thus a code of 'completely agree' is applied.","Last September Ed Davey came out in opposition to Labour's plans to impose VAT in private schools, but they are open to reviewing their charitable status (which benefits private schools by offering lower tax rates). Therefore, they agree with the stated policy but are open to review in some instances. This an agree code is given. However, there has only been one prominent statement on this policy by the Lib Dems.","There are vague party commitments to \"raise legacy benefits\" but there is no direct reference to the two-child benefit cap. However, there have been calls to scrap the cap at the level of party membership and local party branches. The only direct reference to the cap is from Lib Dem MP Tim Farron to recommend the government in February 2023 to \"increase the child element of universal credit by at least £15 a week and abolish the benefit cap\". However, Tim Farron is no longer in the Lib Dem leadership and so cannot be taken as Lib Dem policy. Overall, it is clear that members of the party are sympathetic to lifting the two-child benefit cap. However, there is no concrete mention of the policy at the party level. Because there is some vague reference but not enough to infer direct preference or opposition to the policy, I code 'neither'.","Lib Dem policy priorities indicate a commitment to the NHS, with the only specific being reducing reliance on private dentistry. However, the party makes no reference to privatisation of the NHS, only to commit to a stronger NHS. We cannot infer a position on privatisation based on available statements and policies, and without specific mention, I code 'no opinion'.","The policy plan includes a clear commitment to rapid expansion and protection of social housing within a housebuilding programme: \"Building at least 150,000 new council and social homes a year, giving local authorities the powers to end the right to buy in their areas, and requiring them to have a landlord licensing scheme.\" On the issue of greenfield developments, there is no party wide position, yet it does appear that there is some contestation within the party over housebuilding targets. There also appears to be differentiation across Lib Dem local authorities’ approval of development on greenfield sites. Overall, there is a clear preference for expanding social housing yet reservations on the target numbers built and whether they can be built on greenfield. Therefore, an 'agree' code is given.","The Lib Dems state they \"Respect and defend the rights and identities of all LGBT+ people, including trans and non-binary people\". Historically they have also supported self ID without a medical diagnosis. Pink news describe the Lib Dems as having a good record on trans and non-binary rights. However, the outlet asked the Lib Dems about their current policy on gender recognition, with the response being the party aims to reform the gender recognition process to include non-binary people and to make it less bureaucratic and intrusive. This indicates that overall, the Lib Dems reject the current process and want to make it more progressive. Another piece of evidence is the Lib Dem support for Scotland's Gender Reform Bill, with all Lib Dem SMPs voting in favour of the bill which allows for self ID. From this statement, as well as historical support for LGBTQ+, the party would completely agree with the statement.","The Lib Dem policy plan is clearly in favour of PR: \"We will introduce proportional representation for electing MPs, and local councillors in England\". This also appears to be supported by the membership. A clear 'completely agree' code is given.","Ed Davey has recently come out in favour of Labour's plans to reduce the voting age to 16. However, this is not written formally by the party. At the same time, there is no opposition to the policy. Therefore, it can be inferred that the party completely agree with the policy.","Sewage discharge is an important part of the Lib Dem policy proposal: \"Ending sewage discharges by transforming water companies into public benefit companies, banning bonuses for water bosses until discharges and leaks end, and replacing Ofwat with a tough new regulator with new powers to prevent sewage dumps\". This statement indicates sanctions against water companies and more regulations protecting water systems from these companies. The party also tabled an amendment in the Criminal Justice Bill to criminalise water company bosses who fail to protect waterways from pollution. Overall, the Lib Dems appear to strongly support criminal sanctions for water company bosses who allow pollution.","Lib Dem education policies mostly focus on school repairs and free school meals. There is some move towards greater accountability of Academies to Ofsted, but no further information is given on specifics of the national curriculum. There are no references by the part or its MPs about Academies, and so I code 'no opinion'.","The Lib Dems commit to enhancing cycling and pedestrian networks to reduce traffic and emissions. The Lib Dems, who are more successful at council elections, have overseen LTN development in some constituencies, criticise failed implementation, and are overall supportive of them. Despite no direct reference to supporting widespread adoption of LTNs at the party level, it is clear they have a history of supporting and implementing the policy at the council level, which is where the policy has most impact. Therefore, I infer a completely disagree code.","The Lib Dem policy towards Scotland is \"Ensure a strong union with Scotland by opposing both a second independence referendum and independence\". This is an unambiguous rejection of Scottish independence.","The only relevant source notes that the Lib Dems joined three other parties in the Scottish Parliament to block the UK government's Genetic Technology Bill which would make remove some types of modified crops from the GMOP category (which is already banned in Scotland). This indicates that the Lib Dems seek to maintain the status quo of blocking GM crops in Scotland.","According to The Spectator, all five Scottish Lib Dem SMPs voted in favour of the legislation protecting sexual minorities and transgender people from hate speech (Hate Crime Act), although the outlet accuses the Lib Dems of \"not managed to find its voice on the issue lately\". However, it can be inferred from both their voting patterns and historic support for LGBTQ+ protections that the part does completely agree with the policy.","Welsh independence is not addressed by the Lib Dems. However, due to commitments to a strong union with Scotland, we can infer that the Lib Dems are also against Welsh independence.","There are no recent statements on devolution of powers to the Senedd by the Lib Dems. However, in the 2021 Welsh Lib Dem manifesto in 2021 they argue for a federal UK, going beyond devolution (P59). Further devolution of powers across the UK is also popular amongst the Lib Dem membership. The only other found mention of Welsh devolution comes from Ed Davey during the 2023. Despite limited recent mention of Welsh devolution, there is no indication of change since the 2021 declaration of support for a federal UK by the Welsh Lib Dems, so I code a strong disagree.","Ed Davey was interviewed and supports the 20mph policy but criticised it being applied as default. However, the leader of the Welsh Lib Dems Jane Dodds had to intervene to correct Ed Davey who incorrectly labelled the current policy as default, noting that local authorities have the final say on implementation. On the whole the national Lib Dems support the 20mph policy, as do the Welsh Lib Dems, who defend it in the Senedd. However, support for it being default is less clear since this is not the policy. Davey has shown disagreement with this part of the policy, whilst Dodds has not mentioned support for a default application of the policy. There have been instances on the local level of criticism of the implementation of the policy, which can be considered a blanket default approach, thus showing local level agreement in principle but disagreement with the 'blanket' part of the policy. Therefore, I code an 'agree' to account for the reservations about the default part of the policy.","States their long-term objective is to rejoin EU","States working more closely with EU & NATO on development of defence technology","Human rights as a central value, put it at the heart of trade by banning imports from countries violating human rights","Ed Davey calls for suspension after death of support workers - April 2024","Want to scrap the policy entirely. Focus on processing and resettlement","MP called it 'desperate campaign accouncement' and fear it will take money awa from vital services","Want to make more safe routes from conflict areas","Disappointed government didn't make it a hate crime","Want to 'break the cycle of reoffending by improving rehabilitation' and 'strengthening supervision' in community","Want UK to be net-zero world leader","Focus on wind energy in North Sea but don't explicitly call to ban oil (though say we should move away from gas)","Do not state is specifically in current policy plans but encouraged it in 2022 article and 2017 manifesto","Cannot find anything about minimum wage for 18-20's linked to the Lib Dems","Long-term commitment to universale free childcare","Ed Davey's called it a tax cut for the rich - Sept 2023","Explicitly prioritise public services and intend to raise taxes on banks, capital gains, wealth etc","Against imposing VAT on private schools but suggest reviewing charitable status","Scapping the cap was part of their 2017 and 2019 manifesto and in 2023 conference commitments","Can't find any support for private services, strong focus on public funding (explicitly for NHS dental)","States they want to build 'at least 150,000 new council and social homes a year'","States \"reform of the Gender Recognition Act to remove the requirement for medical reports\"","States \"introducing proportional representation for electing MPs, and local councillors in England.\"","States \"giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote.\"","Failed attempt to legislate this in May 2024","\"Require all state schools including academy and free schools to teach a broad and balanced curriculum.\" p. 4  - 2018 Conference paper","Want them but agree they need improvements","Ed Davey said it would be \"Brexit 2.0\" and damage NHS etc  - 2021","No clear recent answer. In 2005 were against it unless proven safe, affiliated Green Lib Dems unclear on the science etc","Lib Dem MSP's voted for act but still have concerns","Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds: \"10 times more complex and 10 times more painful than Brexit.\", \"a strong, equal and confident Wales inside a strong, equal and confident federal United Kingdom\" - 2021","Ed Davey:  \"Lib Dems to deliver for Wales and to stand up for devolution\" - 2021","Agree 20mp for residential and built-up areas only - not default for all areas","On their website, the LibDems list a series of measures that will gradually bring the UK closer to the EU. They end by stating “essential steps on the road to EU membership, which remains our longer-term objective”.","On their website, the LibDems pledge to cooperate \"more closely with Britain’s NATO and EU partners in the joint development of innovative defence technologies\". This, together with their eventual goal of rejoining the EU would, suggest that this is a policy that they would agree with. Moreover a motion to the LibDem conference in autumn 2022 proposed by LibDem foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran laments the \"UK's failure to take part in EU foreign and security policy schemes”.","In the LibDem Conference in Autumn 2023 a motion was passed on \"Protecting the European Convention on Human Rights\" against what LibDems see as an attack on it by some Tories.","On 3rd April 2024, the Liberal Democrats and their leader Ed Davy called on the government to suspend arms sales to Israel, following the deaths of seven aid workers including three British nationals in an Israeli air strike in Gaza. As the word used is the milder \"suspend\", I am coding this \"Agree\", rather than \"Completely Agree\"","The LibDems describe the Rwanda scheme as \"immoral, unworkable and extortionately expensive for the taxpayer\" and destined to fail. They pledge to scrap it.","The LibDems described the Tories’ plan to bring back national service as a \"reheated announcement\" that \"shows the Conservatives are out of ideas and deserve to be kicked out office”. Responding to the Conservative Party's latest announcement on National Service, Liberal Democrat Defence spokesperson Richard Foord MP said: \"As Suella Braverman once said, when you're in a hole, keep digging.\"","The LibDems advocate \"An expanded refugee resettlement scheme and the creation of humanitarian travel permits to undercut the people traffickers and help those fleeing war and violence.\"","The LibDems plan to \"Make misogyny a hate crime and give police and prosecutors the resources and training they need to prevent and prosecute all hate crimes while supporting survivors.\"","\"The Liberal Democrats are calling on the Conservatives to come clean about how much money has been wasted as they ‘dither and delay’ on prison reform. This includes how much has been spent on prison sentences of 6 months or less since 2019, when the plans to scrap short sentences were first abandoned. The party has long called for comprehensive prison reform, including improving rehabilitation in prisons and on release, and introducing a presumption against short sentences.\" However, at the same time LibDem Home Affairs spokesperson said that \"shopkeepers are being abandoned while criminals are allowed to act with impunity\". On balance, given the parties tendency towards prison reform, I'd assume a \"disagree\", but the evidence is rather weak.","On the LibDem website: \"Climate change is the biggest threat to human existence ... The war in Ukraine has reinforced the need to significantly reduce Britain’s dependence on fossil fuels and grow the renewables sector in order to enhance energy security and achieve net zero.\"","According to the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, the planned Rosebank oil and gas field development off Shetland, which is the UK's largest untapped oil field, should not go ahead. Davey told BBC Scotland News the focus should instead be on renewables and insulating homes.","Wera Hobhouse, the spokesperson for Energy, Climate Change and Transport for the LibDems, while critical of the giant energy companies does not propose a single publicly-owned energy company, but instead proposes giving local authorities more power to build community renewable energy. They also aim to restructure national and local government to deliver net zero by creating a Net Zero Delivery Authority and strengthening the powers and resources of local authorities to cut emissions in their area, and promote community energy. This seems to be a move towards some form of public ownership, but one rather different from that implied by the policy item. I therefore suggest \"neither agree nor disagree\".","All I could find is a VERY old policy document (dated 2016) that states \"Young people earning the National Minimum Wage are paid less than others doing the same job. We believe that wages should reflect the role of the job and the skills required by the individual, not their age. We will therefore equalise the National Minimum Wage across all ages. I would therefore code \"agree\" but I lack confidence in this.","According to Munira Wilson, the LibDem spokesperson for education, the LibDems have a long-term commitment to delivering free, full-time childcare for all children from age two and those with working parents from nine months. They also aim to give disadvantaged children aged two to four with an additional five free hours a week.","In September 2023 LibDem leader Ed Davey said his party would not look to reduce or remove inheritance tax after reports this weekend claimed it was a move being considered by Rishi Sunak ahead of the next election.","While the LibDems ditched a pledge to put 1p on income tax to pay for public services in September 2023, they instead seem to be talking about taxing large corporation more to fund their plans. They also say they'll increase taxes on social media giants to fund mental health professionals in schools. They have not really talked about CUTTING taxes.","In September 2023 the Liberal Democrats have said that they would not support Labour's policy of imposing VAT on private school fees.","In an article dating to February 2024, the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors stated that \"The Liberal Democrats have consistently opposed this policy. ...  Scrapping the two child limit was part of our 2017 and 2019 manifestos and we re-affirmed our commitment to this at our 2023 Autumn Conference.\"","In May 2023, Daisy Cooper, LibDem spokesperson for Health and Social Care, challenged the  Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to comment on a report that stated that the outsourcing of health-care services to the private sector and privatisation of healthcare services might lead to worse population health outcomes.","LibDems are rather sitting on the fence on this issue. A report in the i newspaper dated May2023 states that \"They haven’t quite decided yet\". Similarly, they have have denied reports that plans to build more homes on green belt would be a \"red line\" for the party if it went into coalition with Labour.","According to Edinburgh West LibDem MP Christine Jardine,  the party is committed to reforming the gender recognition process to make it “less bureaucratic and intrusive” and to include non-binary people. Overall, the party is quite strong on trans rights. Although I would choose \"Agree\", the party seems to have become a little lukewarm on this issue, so I think \"neither agree nor disagree\" is also possible.","PR is a central policy of the LibDems","On their website, LibDems pledge to \"strengthen democratic rights and participation by scrapping the Conservatives’ voter ID scheme and giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote.\"","The Liberal Democrats put forward an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill in May 2024, which would have sent water companies to court for sewage dumping. This also appear to include the bosses of said companies.","A LibDem conference motion (autumn 2023) was passed to \"include arts subjects in the English Baccalaureate and give power to Ofsted to monitor the curriculum so that schools continue to provide a rich curriculum including subjects like art, music or drama.\" They pledge to ensure that (Ofsted) \"inspections deliver a complete evaluation of the whole school, including attainment, discipline, curriculum breadth, teacher workload, provision for children with SEND and mental ill health, and suitability of the workforce to deliver the curriculum.\" Given that most schools are now academies or free schools, which are inspected by Ofsted but are not bound by the national curriculum, this IMPLIES (but does not say explicitly) that they should be bound by the national curriculum.","Most of the evidence on LibDems' attitude towards LTNs tend to come from local councillors, some of whom are in favour and some of whom are opposed. Islington Liberal Democrats have said they would hold ‘Citizens’ Assemblies’ to allow resident views to be properly assessed before LTN schemes are brought in. LibDems also acknowledge that LTNs sometimes fail to take the interests of older and disabled people into account. I think a \"neither/nor\" code is the most appropriate due to the diversity of views.","Scottish LibDems have described SNP independence plans as \"crackpot\".","I can find virtually no evidence of the LibDem position on GM crops in recent years, least of all in Scotland. The only evidence is an attack during the coalition years, it which the LibDems criticised Owen Paterson’s rallying call in favour of GM crops. The same article said that the LibDems were \"broadly in favour\" of the new technology.","The hate crime bill (May 2021) was passed with support of LibDem MSPs. It entered into force on 1 April 2024.","Taken from email correspondence from Chloe Hutchinson, Policy Officer of the Welsh Liberal Democrats who coded the party in this way for the “MyVoteChoice”

The Lib Dems have been critical of the government introduced new laws which increase young people in short term prison sentences. The Lib Dems also have a history of alternative routes from prison for petty crimes, but less has been said more recently on the issue. On the issue of repeat offending, at the level of police and crime commissioners for the party there is a preference for rehabilitation in prison and community policing rather than mandatory prison sentences, although this may not reflect a country wide approach. However, overall, it can be inferred that despite not being averse to prison, the Lib Dems prefer rehabilitation and community approaches to petty crimes and even reoffending, warranting a completely disagree code.

Given wider commitments to renewables and it's Net Zero targets, there is a clear indication the Lib Dems want to move away from fossil fuel extraction and thus lean on the side of agree. A 'neither' code could be applied because of the lack of direct references to halting extraction altogether, but I code 'agree' because of the wider context of Lib Dem preference for cutting fossil fuels."]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"style":{"display":"block","white-space":"nowrap","overflow":"hidden","text-overflow":"ellipsis"}},"children":["The Lib Dems were first to propose a windfall tax on energy firms profiting from soaring energy prices and they propose to strengthen such taxes.

Inheritance tax would come under a wealth tax, yet there is no explicit mention of inheritance tax in the immediate term by the Lib Dems.

Fair and progressive taxation is vital to sustain the services that support our economy and society.\" As such there is a clear preference for public service over tax cuts. Concrete plans for taxes commit to being fairer to low earners, and to increase taxes on wealth and larger financial institutions: \"reversing the Conservatives’ tax cuts for big banks, and abolishing the separate Capital Gains tax-free allowance, to tax income from wealth more similarly to income from work\". At the same time, public spending will not exceed tax incomes in normal financial climates.

Greens regret that the UK left the EU and they believe that the UK should rejoin, or at least rejoin the customes union so that some issues resulted by Brexit can be solved (part 9 on their webpage).","Eventhough the Green are opposed by the Common Foreign and Security Policy, it states that the UK should take a a positive role in developing and implementing a consensual common foreign policy under the CFSP (Part 5: EU Common Foreign and Security Policy).","Under part 10, it states that the Green are fully committed to the European convention on Human Rights. Also part 6 \"Human Rights\" section supports that the Greens are against withdrawal.","There isn't a direct say that the UK should stop selling arms to Israel, however it does say that de-escalation of the arms build-up in the region has to happen now.","There is no direct evidence on their webpage but they do mention that there needs to be a safe route for refugees and that the UK should welcome at least 10000 annually under the UN Resettlement Programme. However, on 11.December 2023 the Greens state that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda is inhumane and are very opposed and critical towards the government's agreement on this issue.","There isn't direct statement on this issue, however by reading the Greens policy on peace and defence I thinkt that they will disagree that there should be a mandatory national service as they don't believe that security can only be achieved by having military power.","There isn't a direct statement that the UK should accept more refugees from conflict zone. However when reading it is implied that the UK should accept refugees and treat them with respect","CJ350 states that hate crimes include crime motivated by hatred and discrimination based on ethnicity, colour, gender, trans, sexual orientation, religion, social origin, age, disability including learning difficulties or any other prejudice.","CJ340 states that there are too many people in prisons. Even though it doesn't directly say, the CJ340 indicates that The Greens would completely disagree that repeat offenders should be given mandatory sentences.","The Greens policy is very straight forward when it comes to zero targets and climate change. The UK should UK should target eliminating all carbon dioxide emissions within 10 years and that is why net zero targets cannot be abandoned.","Under the short term policies they state that the Supplementary Tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas producers will be raised, however it does not say directly stat the UK should stop exploiting the oilfields in the North Sea.","They state that there should a diversity of ownership of the energy system including public, municipal and community schemes. However, it does not say directly tgat the government should create a publicly-owned energy company.","Although they don't mention it directly, they emphasise that every citizen's basic right is to a decent wage, and at least minimum wage.","SW308: the Greens state that there should be a universal free childcare for children 1-6 years.","The Greens state that inheritance tax should be completely abolished as a result of Consolidated Income Tax.","EC1050: The Greens critisies the cutting of taxes as this will reduce money avaiable for improving public services.","They directly state that private school would be considered as buisness and will be taxed with VAT and Corporation Tax.","I couldn't find any direct evidence for this issue, however by reading the Greens policy on economy, I believe that the Greens would think the two-child benefit cap should be abolished as no child should live in poverty","They clearly state that the health care should be publically funded with no privatisaion.","The social housing needs to be increased, however no new homes are going to be built and that is why the party position is agree rather than completely agree.","RR531 states that trans, non-binary, genderqueer, third gender, and intersex people should have their gender legally recognised without medical or state encumbrance.","On page 11, The Greens clearly state that the First-Past-the-Post system needs to be replaced by Proportional Representation and Single Transferable Vote (STV).","On page 11, The Greens clearly state that the young people from the age of 16 should have the right to vote.","As the PL431 states that \"Individuals and organisations concerned with generating pollution will be held responsible for the costs of control and for any damage caused, however remote in time or distance. There will be no Crown immunity\". Eventhough it does not state that bossess of water companies shoud face criminal sanctions, the statement implies this.","The Greens believe that the national curriculum should be replaced and that learners and teachers should develop curriculum content to suit their needs and interests (ED041).","The Greens don't mention this specifically for England but more generally that the speed limit in residential areas should be 10mph (TR116).",null,null,null,"If the Welsh citizens decide to become an independent country they can do that via referendum.","The Greens state that the role of the Senedd/Welsh Parliament should increase (PA401).","They don't mention speed limit specifically in wales.

There is a minor mention that such rejoining would be contingent on the political environment and terms of return, but this is so ambiguous and outweighed by massive support for rejoining in the party policy programme.","The Greens support the diplomatic efforts of the EU only on competencies of environment, human rights, economics, and cultural exchange (EU211-5). The Greens want to reform the Council of Ministers to account for consent of each member state, and limit its competency to environment, rights, economic, trade, and diplomatic fields (EU322). The party explicitly rejects the CFSP, seeing the OSCE as the appropriate body for these issues (EU612, EU640). Overall, there is no complete disagreement because there is a role for the EU on some FP issues, but aiming to reform and reject the key institutions of foreign and security policy the Greens reject closer involvement with such institutions.","The party makes it very clear that they view the ECHR as \"The best structure at the European level through which to pursue basic human rights\" and wants to see the EU become a signatory (EU701-2 and EU1011-1012). The Greens completely disagree with the policy.","Following the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, the Greens \"repeated their call for the UK government to cancel all arms export licences to Israel\". The party cite Israel breaching the terms of these export licences and suggests a form of arms embargo. However, it is unclear about the timeframe of such a call, such as whether the Greens would be happy to resume arms exports in the long term if Israel stopped breaching licence terms. However, given wider commitment to curbing the arms trade, this is unlikely, so a completely agree code is given. \"We will diminish dependence on arms sales by ending all government subsidies and will introduce strict licensing regimes to stop military equipment being sent to regimes that violate human rights.\"","The Greens seek to repeal the Rwanda bill and express a preference for managing safe and legal routes for asylum seekers. The party completely disagrees with the Rwanda bill.","\"Green Party co-leader, Carla Denyer said the policy was 'removed from reality'. 'It's not what our military needs and it certainly isn’t what our young people need. 'What young people tell us they need is access to the housing market, to higher education that doesn’t plunge them into debt, and to meaningful jobs that pay well - not military conscription,' she said\". The Greens completely disagree with the policy.","The Greens political philosophy includes a world without borders (MG100) and for people to move where they wish. More specifically on those with refugee status, the Greens want to expand the definition of a refugee \"to include those forced to leave their homes by reason of “external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order\", with climate refugees included in this definition (RA102). This implies favouring expansion of those eligible to be welcomed in the UK with refugee status. Expansion would also cover those persecuted on grounds of protected characteristics and victims of human trafficking. One of the core objectives is also to \"establish a system of asylum and humanitarian protection (hereafter protection) which treats the applicant fairly and humanely and without discrimination\" (RA200). They completely agree with the policy.","The political programme unambiguously states that \"We will make misogyny a hate crime and make it easier to challenge media sexism\" (P13).","A core principle of the party is to keep the list of criminal behaviours as small as possible to focus on the social causes of crime, and that the current retributive model of sentencing as ineffective (CJ111-3). The objective is to \"intervene as minimally as the seriousness of the offence and the circumstance will allow\" (CJ205). In short, the focus is on crime prevention and not prison sentences, and reducing a list of crimes that are solved through prison (such as petty crimes). They completely disagree with the policy.","The Greens do not necessarily consider Net Zero in their programme because it falls short of their actual policy of achieving a zero-carbon society (CC107). However, the Greens actively hold government to account on decisions impacting the objective of the UK becoming Net Zero by 2050. In their 2022 conference policy statements there is inclusion of mandating financial institutions to help meet Net Zero. But again, the Greens objective goes further. This implies that net zero should not be abandoned, but indeed expanded, and so they completely disagree with abandoning the target.","In the immediate term, the Greens criticise the expansion of North Sea fossil fuel licenses. The short-term policy is to tax the profits of North Sea energy producers (EN131). The long-term aim is complete decarbonisation of the energy system, which would mean stopping exploitation of North Sea oil. However, in August 2023 the party announced an Earth Overshoot Action Plan which includes revoking all licences of energy extraction in the North Sea. However, this policy is not found in the main policy sections for the party. Overall, a completely agree code is given due to the criticism of North Sea oil and implied revoking of licenses through planned complete decarbonisation of the UK's energy mix.","The aim is to have public energy companies, which are \"democratic, locally owned networks for energy supply\" and thus shifting control from private energy companies. The operators of the energy grid appear to not be included, but the main emphasis is on the energy companies themselves so a completely agree is coded. The nationalisation of the five largest energy companies is mentioned as a short-term bridge policy (EN133), but the goal in the political programme indicates publicly owned local energy companies. Therefore, they completely agree with the policy.","This is inferred from previous policies from 2019 where the Greens \"make a commitment to extending the £12 living wage to those under the ages of 18, 21, and 25\". However, the Greens aim for a universal basic income for all citizens and enhanced minimum wage legislation (WR361). Although the Greens go further that restoring minimum wage parity, past policies imply equal entitlement to minimum wage for 18-20s.","Past policy announcements highlight plans to extend free childcare for all children aged over 9-months to 35 hours. The long-term goal is free childcare from ages 1-6. A completely disagree code is given since the Greens aim for extending free childcare.","On the one hand, the Greens aim to consolidate all income and wealth transfers, including Inheritance Tax, under a Consolidated Income tax. With their aim of universal basic income, this consolidate income and wealth would all be subject to tax as the tax-free allowance would cover just the universal basic income. As such, this implies that inheritance would be subject to more taxation than it currently is and would be a disagree code (EC722). On the other hand, the policy explicitly states that they will abolish inheritance tax and thus be an agree code (EC726). Because of the nature of the policy, I have given it a neither agree nor disagree code.","The Greens tax principles state that a reason for taxation is to fund public expenditure (EC700). The policy includes increasing taxation on unearned income (EC727), corporate tax rates (EC763) and eco taxes (EC771) etc. They unambiguously agree with them policy.","All private schools will have charitable status removed and would need to pay relevant VAT and Corporation taxes (ED127). This is a very unambiguous complete disagreement with the policy.","In October 2023 the Green party called for the two-child benefit cap to be scrapped in favour of reforming Universal Credit and introducing a wealth tax.","Privatisation of the NHS should not occur in any of its services, from administration, to support services and healthcare provision (HE104). The Greens also commit to reversing privatisation of ancillary services (HE1600). They are unambiguously against privatisation of the NHS.","Social housing must be expanded by increasing the share of new build housing to be social housing to over 50% and ending selloffs of existing stock (HO411). However, on the issue of greenfield sites there is a clear preference for any developments by local authorities to use existing empty buildings rather than developing greenfield sites. Indeed, in 2022 they noted a preference even for Brownfield sites, and although not completely barred, development on greenfield should be avoided. This qualifier reduces the code from a completely agree to just agree.","The policy is that \"trans, non-binary, genderqueer, third gender, and intersex people should have their gender legally recognised and be empowered to update their birth certificate and any other official documents, without medical or state encumbrance\". This is a very clear statement in support of the statement.","The Green's believe that a proportional representation voting system should be introduced to increase the importance of the UK Parliament and end the de-facto two party system (PA451 and PA459-60).","\"The voting age for all elections, and the age at which people may take seats at any level of Government, would be reduced to 16.\" (PA302). This is a very clear statement in support of the policy.","The Greens do not reference criminal sanctions on water companies but do support the issue. Caroline Lucas once criticised the government for reducing legal restrictions on water pollution, but no recent mention of legal repercussions has been made. Instead, they emphasis is on bringing water services into public ownership as part of their wider program of public ownership of utilities and services. It is hard to determine the position of the party, but because they make no (found) reference to criminal sanctions. because of the lack of support for the criminal sanctions component of the policy but overall sympathy for the approach, I code 'agree' (although a completely agree could be justified).","The Greens are opposed to creating more academies and Free Schools and seek to reintegrate existing Academies into the Local Authority school system (ED134). One of the reasons given for this policy is that Academies are free to set the curriculum and are thus not accountable to Local Authorities and the Secretary of State for Education (and are thus undemocratic) (ED130). By being opposed to Academies in the first place, the Greens are unambiguously in complete disagreement with their control over the curriculum.","There is no party wide policy on this issue although it can be inferred through its principles of \"streets for all\". This principle includes a 20mph limit in all built up areas and the use of traffic calming measures (policies that are LTNs in all but name) (TR113). The political programme also mentions clean air zones, a similar policy. However, on the level of local authorities the support for LTNs is far clearer, with campaigning for the policy in areas like Easling, Hackney, and Exeter. Despite no direct mention of the LTNs in the policy programme, the policies that are mentioned are similar to the LTNs whilst there is a clear party effort at the local level to implement, so a complete disagree code is given.",null,null,null,"The Green party in England and Wales as a whole believe that the constituent countries of the UK should have a degree of autonomy, and even independence should they wish to express their preference via referenda (PA401). The Wales Green Party are far more upfront with their preference, believing that \"an independent Wales is vital for creating a fairer, greener society\" and are actively part of the Welsh independence movement since at least 2022. There is therefore some minor split within the party as to commitment to Welsh independence, with the main party not averse to independence but on the condition of a referendum should the citizens of Wales choose one, whereas the Wales Greens are actively pro-independence. Because of this minor split that the main party having the qualifier, I code an agree code rather than completely agree code. A ‘completely disagree' code can also be justified.","The Green Party is unambiguous in its support for increasing the role of the Senedd (PA400), increased self-government (PA401), including in tax raising power (PA403).","Although there is no specific reference to 20 mph limits in residential areas in Wales found beyond the Wales Greens manifesto in 2016, the party is in general committed to \"a 20m.p.h. limit throughout built up areas, including villages\", which can be taken to mean across England and Wales (TR113). Therefore, a completely agree code is applied.","The Green Party is committed to rejoining the EU when the time is right.","According to the Green Party website \"The Green Party regrets that the UK no longer has a place at discussions of defence and security policy in the EU. ...We will seek to cooperate closely with the EU in support of European and global peace and security.\"","According to the Green Party website, \"The Green Party is committed to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.\"","In April 2024 the Green Party repeated their call for the UK government to cancel all arms export licences to Israel.","In April 2024, Green Party leader Carla Denyer described the Rwanda scheme as a \"punitive, inhumane approach\".","On 26 May 2024, Green Party co-leader, Carla Denyer described the Tories' plan to bring back national service as \"removed from reality\".","According to their website, the Green Party \"acknowledges the right to claim asylum, in any country, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\" It will \"will extend the applicable definition of a refugee to include those forced to leave their homes by reason of “external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order” (Convention of the Organisation of African Unity 1969)\".","The Green Party has long (since at least 2018) called for mysogyny to be recognised as a hate crime. This was reaffirmed by the Green candidate to be London mayor, Zoe Garbett in April 2024.","According to the Green Party website \"The Green Party is ... committed to significantly reducing the prison population. To that end, a range of measures will be used, including changes to sentencing policy and practice. Courts will have a duty to reduce use of custodial sentencing in favour of community sentencing.\"","Achieving net zero is central to the Green Party's philosophy.","The Green Party vehemently opposes fossil fuel extraction.","The Green Party has called for the big five energy suppliers to be brought into public ownership.

This would include money received from inheritance. While it would no longer be called Inheritance Tax, the actual tax paid on inherited wealth will actually be increased. We therefore have to score \"completely disagree\" on that one.","According to Green policies, not only would tax rates will be banded and will increase progressively so that those on higher consolidated incomes pay higher marginal rates of tax, but a Green government would implement an annual wealth tax on households above a certain level of wealth. Profits distributed abroad will be taxed. Finally a new Land Tax will be introduced. Finally, the Greens support a global minimum corporate tax rate but would increase it to at least 21%. In terms of spending the Greens call for public funds (either through taxation or, where necessary, public borrowing) to be used to build all new hospitals, schools and other public service infrastructure.","According to the Green Party website \"Schools which remain in the private sector would be classed as a business and have all charitable status removed; they would pay all relevant taxes such as VAT and Corporation Tax.\"","The Green Party advocates the scrapping of the scrap two-child benefit cap.","On 8th April 2024, the co-leader of the Green Party, Carla Denyer, criticised Wes Streeting's proposal for an increased role for the private sector in the NHS, saying that “The Green Party has never had any truck with the profit motive in health care and will continue to push for a fully publicly funded NHS.","While the Green Party recognise that there is a need for more affordable homes to meet local needs, most new homes should be provided in towns as more homes in town centres can contribute to their regeneration. The first priority should therefore be to put empty and redundant buildings back into use. The Green Party believes that development on brownfield sites should always be prioritised over greenfield sites.","According to the Green Party website: \"The Green Party believes that trans, non-binary, genderqueer, third gender, and intersex people should have their gender legally recognised and be empowered to update their birth certificate and any other official documents, without medical or state encumbrance. We support the right for individuals to update their legally recognised gender by self-determination, the only requirement being a statutory declaration, to how they would describe their gender, including having the option to change their name on all documents.","The Green Party fully support electoral reform and prefer the Single Transferrable Vote, Alternative Vote Plus and Additional Member Systems of proportional representation. They consider the first-past-the-post (FPTP) unacceptable.","The Green Party's policy is that \"The voting age for all elections, and the age at which people may take seats at any level of Government, would be reduced to 16.\"","The Green Party have not talked about criminal penalties for the bosses of water companies. Instead, they focus on bringing the water companies back into public control. However, the Green party's only MP voted in favour of an amendment by Tim Farron to the Criminal Justice Bill (New Clause 91) making failure to meet pollution performance commitment levels a criminal offence.","The Greens would replace the National School Curriculum with a set of learning entitlements. Given that they want to integrate Free Schools and Academies into the Local Authority school system, Free Schools and Academies will be subject to the new learning entitlements. Because they want ALL schools to be bound by the national framework (including those that are now Free Schools and Academies), I suggest a \"completely disagree\" code.","According to the Green Party website, the party prioritises \"the reduction of excessive speeds on streets and the reallocation of road space away from cars, with the aim of making all streets places which all people feel able to use.\" It \"would introduce a 20m.p.h. limit throughout built up areas, including villages.\"","The Green Party coded here is the Green Party of England and Wales.
